GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	V
CONTENTS  The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2is a medical ref-
erence product designed to inform and educate readers
about a wide variety of disorders, conditions, treatments,
and diagnostic tests. The Gale Group believes the product
to be comprehensive, but not necessarily definitive. It is
intended to supplement, not replace, consultation with a
physician or other healthcare practitioner. While the Gale
Group has made substantial efforts to provide information
that is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date, the Gale
Group makes no representations or warranties of any
kind, including without limitation, warranties of mer-
chantability or fitness for a particular purpose, nor does it
guarantee the accuracy, comprehensiveness, or timeliness
of the information contained in this product. Readers
should be aware that the universe of medical knowledge
is constantly growing and changing, and that differences
of medical opinion exist among authorities. Readers are
also advised to seek professional diagnosis and treatment
for any medical condition, and to discuss information
obtained from this book with their health care provider.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	VII
PLEASE READ—IMPORTANT INFORMATION  The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 (GEM2)is a
one-stop source for medical information on nearly 1,700
common medical disorders, conditions, tests, and treat-
ments, including high-profile diseases such as AIDS,
Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and heart attack. This ency-
clopedia avoids medical jargon and uses language that
laypersons can understand, while still providing thor-
ough coverage of each topic. The Gale Encyclopedia of
Medicine 2fills a gap between basic consumer health
resources, such as single-volume family medical guides,
and highly technical professional materials.
SCOPE
Almost 1,700 full-length articles are included in the
Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2, including disorders/
conditions, tests/procedures, and treatments/therapies.
Many common drugs are also covered, with generic drug
names appearing first and brand names following in
parentheses, eg. acetaminophen (Tylenol). Throughout
the Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2, many prominent
individuals are highlighted as sidebar biographies that
accompany the main topical essays. Articles follow a
standardized format that provides information at a
glance. Rubrics include:
Disorders/Conditions Tests/Treatments

Key terms Key terms
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest
in holistic medicine that emphasizes the connection
between mind and body. Aimed at achieving and main-
taining good health rather than just eliminating disease,
this approach has come to be known as alternative medi-
cine. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2includes a
number of essays on alternative therapies, ranging from
traditional Chinese medicine to homeopathy and from
meditation to aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on
alternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific
Alternative treatmentsections for diseases and condi-
tions that may be helped by complementary therapies.
INCLUSION CRITERIA
A preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-
ments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,
including professional medical guides and textbooks as
well as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general
advisory board, made up of public librarians, medical
librarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-
ics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted
by category and sent to GEM2medical advisors, certified
physicians with various medical specialities, for review.
Final selection of topics to include was made by the med-
ical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.
ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS
The essays were compiled by experienced medical
writers, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and
other health care professionals. GEM2medical advisors
reviewed the completed essays to insure that they are
appropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.

Abdominal ultrasound
Definition
Ultrasound technology allows doctors to “see”
inside a patient without resorting to surgery. A transmit-
ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,
where they bounce off the different tissues and organs to
produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver
“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a
computer, which translates the data into an image on a
television screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish
subtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is
particularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the
abdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.
Purpose
The potential medical applications of ultrasound
were first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the
sonar technology developed to detect submarines during
World War II. The first useful medical images were pro-
duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-
ty had improved to the point that it came into general
medical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-
tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low
cost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the
top drawer of medical imaging techniques.
While pelvic ultrasoundis widely known and com-
monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy,
ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal
imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-
nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing
radiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than
plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft
tissue structures, and can be used in any of several
modes, depending on the need at hand.
As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally
is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute
abdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-
pected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-
creatic disease,gallstones, spleen disease, kidney dis-
ease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal
aortic aneurysm. Specifically:
• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can
signal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or
injury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound
scanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-
tial causes when presented with general or ambiguous
symptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be
studied for signs of disease that appear as changes in
size, shape and internal structure.
• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a
car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured
abdominal organs is often the most serious threat to
survival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are
immediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as an
initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and it
can be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severity
of hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds,from
a bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreign
object and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.
The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-
nology has brought it into common emergency room
use, and even into limited ambulance service.
• Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths—tumors, cysts,
abscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs—can beA

particular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be
distinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and
abscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ or
part of the abdomen can be found.
• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver
disease are numerous, though jaundicetends to be a
general symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between
many of the types and causes of liver malfunction, and
is particularly good at identifying obstruction of the
bile ducts and cirrhosis, which is characterized by
abnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.
• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of
the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as are
pancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt proper
functioning.
• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions
than any other digestive malady. These calculi can
cause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and also
obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes
from the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-
stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.
• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to
injury during abdominal trauma. It may also become
painfully inflamed when beset with infection or
cancer. These conditions also lend themselves well to
ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.
• Kidney disease.
• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak
spot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood
directly from the heart to the entire lower body. These
aneurysms are relatively common and increase in
prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-
nently life-threatening. However, they can be readily
identified and monitored with ultrasound before acute
complications result.
Ultrasound technology can also be used for treat-
ment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during
surgical procedures—such as guiding needle placement
to drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for
biopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications for
ultrasound are being developed.
The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies
in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just like
audible sound, and vibrate the materials through which
they pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-
able at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.
Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound can
be used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.
High-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat
soft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated
scarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-
mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-
ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound can
also be used to physically destroy certain types of
tumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.
Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound is
an active area of medical research.
Precautions
Properly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually
without risk or side effects. Some patients report feeling
a slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, but
most feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriate
frequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-
vate any medical condition, though any woman who
thinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue with
her doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.
The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,
however, depends greatly on the quality of the equipment
used and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.
Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound can
be worse than useless if it indicates that a problem exists
where there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-
tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-
sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment can
perform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patients
should not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-
cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as the
quality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-
posed procedure.
In cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,
patients should educate themselves about the proposed
procedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-
ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominal
ultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may be
hampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, such
as the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaque
to ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are often
not good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.
Description
Ultrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-
quency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, or
cycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-
quencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 22
Abdominal ultrasound
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2  KEY TERMS
Accessory organ—A lump of tissue adjacent to an
organ that is similar to it, but which serves no
important purpose, if functional at all. While not
necessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob-
lems if they grow too large or become cancerous. In
any case, their presence points to an underlying
abnormality in the parent organ.
Benign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite of
malignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is
stable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.
Biopsy—The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-
sue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the
term refers to the collection and analysis of tissue
from a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.
Calculus—Any type of hard concretion (stone) in
the body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-
creas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-
lation of excess mineral salts and other organic
material such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can
cause problems by lodging in and obstructing the
proper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines or
urine to the bladder.
Cirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized by
the invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-
tion of proper functioning—jaundice is often an
accompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include
alcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-
tive heart disease.
Common bile duct—The branching passage
through which bile—a necessary digestive
enzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder into
the small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the
pancreas also enter the intestines through the com-
mon bile duct.
Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special-
ized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused
and relatively low energy radiation to produce
detailed two-dimensional images of soft tissue
structures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the
chief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higher
quality images not disrupted by bone or gas. They
are, however, more cumbersome, time consuming
and expensive to perform, and they use ionizing
electromagnetic radiation.
Doppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent
change in frequency of sound wave echoes returning
to a stationary source from a moving target. If the
object is moving toward the source, the frequency
increases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-
cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can be
used to compute the object’s speed—be it a car on
the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effect
holds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.
Frequency—Sound, whether traveling through air
or the human body, produces vibrations—mole-
cules bouncing into each other—as the shock wave
travels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-
ber of vibrations per second. Within the audible
range, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-
quency, the higher a sound’s pitch.
Ionizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv-
ing tissue by disrupting and destroying individual
cells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear
radiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—are
potentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate
the material through which they pass, but do not
ionize it.
Jaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint
to the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in
the liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate
cause, but the underlying cause could be as simple
as obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-
stone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound
can distinguish between these conditions.
Malignant—The term literally means growing worse
and resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for
cancerous and connotes a harmful condition that
generally is life-threatening.
Morphology—Literally, the study of form. In medi-
cine, morphology refers to the size, shape and
structure rather than the function of a given organ.
As a diagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facil-
itates the recognition of abnormal morphologies as
symptoms of underlying conditions.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	3
Abdominal ultrasound
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 3  Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more
detailed images, but are also more readily absorbed and
so cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominal
ultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies
between 2-5 MHz.
An ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the
transducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces
the sound waves that penetrate the body and receives the
reflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-
tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity that
is produced when you put pressure on certain crystals
such as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-
es by producing sound waves ( they are transmitting
waves) and react to sound waves by producing electric
pulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-
es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce the
scanning sound waves. The transducer then receives the
returning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses
and sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-
nizes the data into an image on a television screen.
Because sound waves travel through all the body’s
tissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles per
hour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to be
received can be plotted on the screen as a distance into the
body. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the
specific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can be
plotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, the
echoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surrounded
by bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines and
bowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because the
waves are blocked or become randomly scattered.
Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med-
ical imaging:
• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in
which a single transducer scans a line through the body
with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of
depth. This method is used to measure distances within
the body and the size of internal organs. Therapeutic
ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also
A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the
destructive wave energy.
• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-
ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body
that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on
screen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100
transducers in sequence form the basis for these most
commonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.
• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence
of B-mode scans whose images follow each other in
sequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-
sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that
produce reflections move relative to the probe. M-
mode ultrasound has been put to particular use in
studying heart motion.
• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonographyincludes the
capability of accurately measuring velocities of moving
material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-
ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measure
the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability is
most often combined with B-mode scanning to produce
images of blood vessels from which blood flow can be
directly measured. This technique is used extensively to
investigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-
tension, particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-
inal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. These
machines cost about $250,000.
The actual procedure for a patient undergoing an
abdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless of
the type of scan or its purpose. Fastingfor at least eight
hours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach is
empty and as small as possible, and that the intestines
and bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows the
gall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating and
may not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a
full bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the way
so that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.
The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gel
that allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across the
skin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.
This procedure is conducted by a doctor with the
assistance of a technologist skilled in operating the
equipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen to
obtain different views of the target areas. The patient will
likely be asked to change positions from side to side and
to hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desired
views. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.
The many types and uses of ultrasound technology
makes it difficult to generalize about the time and costs
involved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-
cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aortic
aneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform and
will cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending on
the quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-
tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-mode
and Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targets
not well defined in advance, generally take more time
and are more expensive.
Regardless of the type of scan used and the potential
difficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and
less expensive than computed tomography scans(CT),
its primary rival in abdominal imaging. Furthermore, as
abdominal ultrasounds are generally undertaken as
“medically necessary” procedures designed to detect the
presence of suspected abnormalities, they are covered
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 24
Abdominal ultrasound
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 4  under most types of major medical insurance. As always,
though, the patient would be wise to confirm that their
coverage extends to the specific procedure proposed. For
nonemergency situations, most underwriters stipulate
prior approval as a condition of coverage.
Specific conditions for which ultrasound may be
selected as a treatment option—certain types of tumors,
lesions,kidney stonesand other calculi, muscle and lig-
ament injuries, etc.—are described in detail under the
appropriate entries in this encyclopedia.
Preparation
A patient undergoing abdominal ultrasound will be
advised by their physician about what to expect and how
to prepare. As mentioned above, preparations generally
include fasting and arriving for the procedure with a full
bladder, if necessary. This preparation is particularly use-
ful if the gallbladder, ovaries or veins are to be examined.
Aftercare
In general, no aftercare related to the abdominal
ultrasound procedure itself is required.
Risks
Abdominal ultrasound carries with it no recognized
risks or side effects, if properly performed using appropri-
ate frequency and intensity ranges. Sensitive tissues, par-
ticularly those of the reproductive organs, could possibly
sustain damage if violently vibrated by overly intense
ultrasound waves. In general though, such damage would
only result from improper use of the equipment.
Any woman who thinks she might be pregnant
should raise this issue with her doctor before undergoing
an abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early stages of
development could be injured by ultrasound meant to
probe deeply recessed abdominal organs.
Normal results
As a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal abdom-
inal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence of the
suspected condition that prompted the scan. For example,
symptoms such as a persistent cough, labored breathing,
and upper abdominal pain suggest the possibility of,
among other things, an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An
ultrasound scan that indicates the absence of an aneurysm
would rule out this life-threatening condition and point to
other, less serious causes.
Abnormal results
Because abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally
undertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the results
of a scan often will prove abnormal—that is they will
confirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis of
the liver or an aortic aneurysm. At that point, appropriate
medical treatment as prescribed by a patient’s doctor is in
order. See the relevant disease and disorder entries in this
encyclopedia for more information.

Abdominal wall defects
Definition
Abdominal wall defects are birth (congenital)
defects that allow the stomach or intestines to protrude.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	5
Abdominal wall defects
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 5  Description
Many unexpected and fascinating events occur dur-
ing the development of a fetus inside the womb. The
stomach and intestines begin development outside the
baby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wall
enclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical opening
is too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-
els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through the
abdominal wall.
Causes and symptoms
There are many causes for birth defectsthat still
remain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal wall
defects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother may
have to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus
are nondescript.
Diagnosis
At birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of
the umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worse
cases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, an
ultrasound examination may detect the problem. It is
always necessary in children with one birth defect to look
for others, because birth defects are usually multiple.
Treatment
Abdominal wall defects are effectively treated with
surgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-
alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.
The organs are normal, just misplaced. However, if the
defect is large, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera into
the small abdominal cavity.
Prognosis
If there are no other defects, the prognosis after sur-
gical repair of this condition is relatively good. However,
KEY TERMS
Hernia—Movement of a structure into a place it
does not belong.
Umbilical—Referring to the opening in the
abdominal wall where the blood vessels from the
placenta enter.
Viscera—Any of the body’s organs located in the
chest or abdomen.
10% of those with more severe or additional abnormali-
ties die from it. The organs themselves are fully function-
al; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen.
The condition is, in fact, a herniarequiring only replace-
ment and strengthening of the passageway through
which it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure in
the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of
the organs inside.
Prevention
Some, but by no means all, birth defects are pre-
ventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good nutri-
tion, supplemental vitamins, diligent avoidance of all
unnecessary drugs and chemicals—especially tobacco—
and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.

Definition
Partial birth abortion is a method of late-term abor-
tion that terminates a pregnancyand results in the death
and intact removal of a fetus. This procedure is most
commonly referred to as intact dilatation and extraction
(D & X).
Purpose
Partial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to end a
pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus, typically in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 26
Abortion, partial birth
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 6  the late second or third trimester. Although D&X is high-
ly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-
tages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-
stances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus is
removed largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and
autopsyof the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.
Intact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower risk
of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Another
perceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancy
without requiring the woman to go through labor, which
may be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of
late-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lower
cost and shorter procedure time.
Precautions
Women considering D&X should be aware of the
highly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-
versy common to all late-term abortions is whether the
fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s
body. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that
fetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal
body has exited the uterus. Several states have taken
legal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians
who perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may
restrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-
ing late-term abortion.
Description
Intact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves
administration of medications to cause the cervix to
dilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, the
physician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.
The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet
first, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,
the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of
the skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the
contents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,
which results in the death of the fetus, and reduces the
sizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through
the cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is then
removed from the woman’s body.
Preparation
Medical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient
visit to administer medications, such as laminaria,to
cause the cervix to begin dilating.
In addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local
legal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,
counseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewing
stages of fetal development,childbirth, alternative abor-
tion methods, and adoption.
KEY TERMS
Cervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus that
separates the uterus from the vaginal canal.
Footling breech—A position of the fetus while in
the uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest
the cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exit
the uterus, with the head of the fetus being the last
part to exit the uterus.
Laminaria—A medical product made from a cer-
tain type of seaweed that is physically placed near
the cervix to cause it to dilate.
Aftercare
D&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-
tal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to
monitor the woman for any complications.
Risks
With all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion
is performed, the more complicated the procedure and
the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to
associated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of
injury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood
clots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,
and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk
of incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not
dead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible
long-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or
carrying a future pregnancy to term.
Normal results
The expected outcome of D&X is the termination of
a pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the
woman’s body.

Abortion, selective
Definition
Selective abortion, also known as selective reduc-
tion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a
multi-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to the
mother in carrying and giving birth to more than one or
two babies, and also to decrease the risk of complications
to the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortion
also refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such as
the woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be born
with some birth defect or impairment, or because the sex
of the fetus is not preferred by the individual.
Purpose
A woman may decide to abort for health reasons, for
example, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-
nancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.
However, selective reduction is recommended often in
cases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more than
one fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In the
general population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only
about 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-
cies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.
Precautions
Because women or couples who use fertility drugs
have made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-
ble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-
able with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-
fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-
ment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetal
pregnancy and consider the prospect of recommended
reduction before undergoing fertility treatment.
Description
Selective reduction is usually performed between
nine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful
when performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-	dure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-	dle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina and	potassium chloride is injected into the fetus.
Preparation
Individuals who have chosen selective reduction to
safeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled
prior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-
mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to
both the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks
after the reduction.
Individuals seeking an abortion for any reason
should consider the ethical implications whether it be
because the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the
fetus would be born with a severe birth defect.
Aftercare
Counseling should continue after the abortion
because it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel
guilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental
health professionals should be consulted throughout the
process.
Risks
About 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-
tion will go into premature labor. About 4-5% of
women undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one
or more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated
with multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.
Normal results
In cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or
more fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically
develop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.

Therapeutic abortion is the intentional termination
of a pregnancybefore the fetus can live independently.
Abortion has been a legal procedure in the United States
since 1973.
Purpose
An abortion may be performed whenever there is
some compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women
have abortions because continuing the pregnancy would
cause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or
because prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be
born with severe abnormalities.
Abortions are safest when performed within the first
six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-
culation of this date is referred to as the gestational age
and is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. For
example, a woman who is two weeks late having her
period is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is six
weeks since she last menstruated.
About 90% of women who have abortions do so
before 13 weeks and experience few complications.
Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higher

rate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are
extremely rare and are usually limited to situations where
the life of the mother is in danger.
Precautions
Most women are able to have abortions at clinics or
outpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early in
pregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlled
epilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who
are HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatients
if precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-
vious endocarditis,asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter-
ine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-
trolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually
need to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-
toring and medications during the procedure.
Description
Very early abortions
Between five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be
ended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This
procedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,
mini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of the
uterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic
tube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suction
is applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.
Another method is called the “morning after” pill, or
emergency contraception. Basically, it involves taking
high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours of
having unprotected sex. The high doses of hormones
causes the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-
port a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it is
simply expelled from the body.
There are two types of emergency contraception.
One type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, and
uses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type is
available with a prescription under the brand name Pre-
ven. But women can even use their regular birth control
pills for emergency contraception, after they check with
their doctor about the proper dose. About half of women
who use birth control pills for emergency contraception
get nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts the
risk of pregnancy 75 percent.
The other type of morning-after pill contains only
one hormone: progestin, and is available under the brand
name Plan B. It is more effective than the first type with
a lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the risk
of pregnancy 89 percent.
Women should check with their physicians regard-
ing the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the

work for emergency contraception.
Menstrual extractions are safe, but because the
amount of fetal material is so small at this stage of devel-
opment, it is easy to miss. This results in an incomplete
abortion that means the pregnancy continues.
First trimester abortions
The first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13
weeks after the last menstrual period. In the United
States, about 90% of abortions are performed during this
period. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,
and the time in which women have the most choice of
how the procedure is performed.
MEDICAL ABORTIONS.Medical abortions are brought
about by taking medications that end the pregnancy. The
advantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:
• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments
are used.
• Anesthesia is not required.
• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.
• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.
Disadvantages of a medical abortion are:
• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.
• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.
• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-
gical abortion.
• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is
expelled.
Two different medications can be used to bring about
an abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-
ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.
On the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives
an injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, about
a week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an
oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for
various hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction
(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the
uterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the
contents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-
up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the
abortion is complete.
With this procedure, a woman will feel cramping
and may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This
combination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending
pregnancy.
Mifepristone(RU-486), which goes by the brand
name Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-
esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,
then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the
pregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the
first day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to
the doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days
later she returns and, if the miscarriage has not
occurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the
uterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to
take misoprostol. After an observation period, she
returns home.
Within four days, 90% of women have expelled the
contents of their uterus and completed the abortion.
Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the
abortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-
sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound that
the procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, a
surgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8
percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion
after taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in
about 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortion
is recommended because the fetus may be damanged.
Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy
cramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor-
mal period and may last up to 16 days.
Mifepristone is not recommended for women with
ectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long-

blood-thinners such as Coumadin.
Surgical abortions
First trimester surgical abortions are performed
using vacuum aspiration. The procedure is also called
dilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-
um curettage, or suction curettage.
Advantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:
• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.
• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.
• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.
• The woman does not see the products of her womb
being removed.
Disadvantages include:
• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.
• Infection may occur.
During a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is
gradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into the
cervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-
tion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-
tents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is
97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a woman
feels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is often
given to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterine
cramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman may
return home.
Second trimester abortions
Although it is better to have an abortion during the
first trimester, some second trimester abortions may be
inevitable. The results of genetic testingare often not
available until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especially
teens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come to
terms with it emotionally soon enough to have a first
trimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-
ing second trimester abortions.
Some second trimester abortions are performed as a
D & E. The procedures are similar to those used in the
first trimester, but a larger suction tube must be used
because more material must be removed. This increases
the amount of cervical dilation necessary and increases
the risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctant
to perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for some
women is it not a medically safe option.
The alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is
an abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may require
an overnight stay in a hospital. The day before the proce-
dure, the woman visits the doctor for tests, and to either

receive medication that will soften the cervix and speed
up labor.
On the day of the abortion, drugs, usually prosta-
glandins to induce contractions, and a salt water solution,
are injected into the uterus. Contractions begin, and with-
in eight to 72 hours the woman delivers the fetus.
Side effects of this procedure include nausea, vomit-
ing, and diarrheafrom the prostaglandins, and pain
from uterine cramps. Anesthesia of the sort used in
childbirthcan be given to mask the pain. Many women
are able to go home a few hours after the procedure.
Very early abortions cost between $200-$400. Later
abortions cost more. The cost increases about $100 per
week between the thirteenth and sixteenth week. Second
trimester abortions are much more costly because they
often involve more risk, more services, anesthesia, and
sometimes a hospital stay. Insurance carriers and HMOs
may or may not cover the procedure. Federal law pro-

being used to pay for an elective abortion.
Preparation
The doctor must know accurately the stage of a
woman’s pregnancy before an abortion is performed. The
doctor will ask the woman questions about her menstrual
cycle and also do a physical examinationto confirm the
stage of pregnancy. This may be done at an office visit
before the abortion or on the day of the abortion. Some
states require a waiting period before an abortion can be
performed. Others require parental or court consent for a
child under age 18 to receive an abortion.
Despite the fact that almost half of all women in the
United States have had at least one abortion by the time
they reach age 45, abortion is surrounded by controversy.
Women often find themselves in emotional turmoil when
deciding if an abortion is a procedure they wish to under-
go. Pre-abortion counseling is important in helping a
woman resolve any questions she may have about having
the procedure.
Aftercare
Regardless of the method used to perform the abor-
tion, a woman will be observed for a period of time to
make sure her blood pressure is stable and that bleeding
is controlled. The doctor may prescribe antibioticsto
reduce the chance of infection. Women who are Rh nega-
tive (lacking genetically determined antigens in their red
blood cells that produce immune responses) should be
given a human Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) after the
procedure unless the father of the fetus is also Rh nega-
tive. This prevents blood incompatibility complications
in future pregnancies.
Bleeding will continue for about five days in a surgical
abortion and longer in a medical abortion. To decrease the
risk of infection, a woman should avoid intercourse and not
use tampons and douches for two weeks after the abortion.
A follow-up visit is a necessary part of the woman’s
aftercare. Contraception will be offered to women who
wish to avoid future pregnancies, because menstrual
periods normally resume within a few weeks.
Risks
Serious complications resulting from abortions per-
formed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of women
who have abortions in this time period, 2.5% have minor
complications that can be handled without hospitaliza-
tion. Less than 0.5% have complications that require a
hospital stay. The rate of complications increases as the
pregnancy progresses.
Complications from abortions can include:
• uncontrolled bleeding
• infection
• blood clots accumulating in the uterus
• a tear in the cervix or uterus
• missed abortion where the pregnancy continues
• incomplete abortion where some material from the
pregnancy remains in the uterus
Women who experience any of the following symp-
toms of post-abortion complications should call the clin-
ic or doctor who performed the abortion immediately.
• severe pain
• fever over 100.4°F (38.2°C)
• heavy bleeding that soaks through more than one sani-
tary pad per hour
• foul-smelling discharge from the vagina
• continuing symptoms of pregnancy
Normal results
Usually the pregnancy is ended without complica-
tion and without altering future fertility.

Abscess
Definition
An abscess is an enclosed collection of liquefied tis-
sue, known as pus, somewhere in the body. It is the result
of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign material.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 212
Abcess
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 12  Description
There are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.
Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are the
result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-
where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune
response are required. In response to the invading germ,
white blood cells gather at the infected site and begin
producing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ
by digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the
germs and breaking them down into small pieces that can
be picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the
body. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body
tissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-
cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-
ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,
and enzymes.
An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that
begins with a process called inflammation. Initially, as
the invading germ activates the body’s immune system,
several events occur:
• Blood flow to the area increases.
• The temperature of the area increases due to the
increased blood supply.
• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,
and other liquids.
• It turns red.
• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and
the chemical activity.
These four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—
characterize inflammation.
As the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn
to liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an
abscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies
more and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-
lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easily
digested. A good example is an abscess just beneath the
skin. It most easily continues along beneath the skin
rather than working its way through the skin where it
could drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscess
also leak into the general circulation and produce symp-
toms just like any other infection. These include chills,
fever, aching, and general discomfort.
Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the
same process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-
tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin is
not absorbed, it stays where it was injected and may
cause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—
sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterile
abscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps as
they scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.
Causes and symptoms
Many different agents cause abscesses. The most
common are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like
Staphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the cause
of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the large
bowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused by
any of the numerous bacteria found within the large
bowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be caused
by any organism that can travel there through the circula-
tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel in
this fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body are
caused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-
tures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-
ic abscesses are:
• skin abscesses by normal skin flora
• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora
• lung abscesses by normal airway flora,pneumonia
germs, or tuberculosis
• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora
Specific types of abscesses
Listed below are some of the more common and
important abscesses.
• Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceous
glands) on the back or the back of the neck are the ones
usually infected. The most common germ involved is
Staphylococcus aureus. Acneis a similar condition of
sebaceous glands on the face and back.
• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a
tiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac-
teria can enter this opening, causing an infection and
subsequent abscess.

As a result of throat infections like strep throatand
tonsillitis, bacteria can invade the deeper tissues of the
throat and cause an abscess. These abscesses can com-
promise swallowing and even breathing.
• Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether it’s
due to bacteria [common pneumonia], tuberculosis,
fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can develop
as a complication.
• Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestines
can spread through the blood to the liver and cause
abscesses.
• Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen on
either side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles.
They flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one of
these muscles, usually when it spreads from the appen-
dix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes.
Diagnosis
The common findings of inflammation—heat, red-
ness, swelling, and pain—easily identify superficial
abscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce only
generalized symptoms such as fever and discomfort. If
the patient’s symptoms and physical examinationdo not
help, a physician may have to resort to a battery of tests to

locate the site of an abscess, but usually something in the
initial evaluation directs the search. Recent or chronic dis-
ease in an organ suggests it may be the site of an abscess.
Dysfunction of an organ or system—for instance, seizures
or altered bowel function—may provide the clue. Pain
and tenderness on physical examination are common
findings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-
nel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterile
abscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-
tock where a shot was given.
Treatment
Since skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,
it acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals of
an abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,
the pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.
The surgeon determines when the abscess is ready for
drainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing the
pus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaining
infection, sometimes with the help of antibioticsor other
drugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth or
rubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closing
before all the pus has drained out.
Alternative treatment
If an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be
slowly working its way through the skin as it is more
rapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals
work faster at higher temperatures, applications of hot
compresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten the
digestion of the skin and eventually result in its breaking
down, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment is
best reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-
gerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.
It is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their very
early stages. It will “ripen” them.
Contrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and cold
compresses, can also help assist the body in resorption of
the abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies that
work to rebalance the body in relation to abscess forma-
tion,Silicaand Hepar sulphuris. In cases of septic
abscesses, bentonite clay packs (bentonite clay and a
small amount of Hydrastispowder) can be used to draw
the infection from the area.
Prognosis
Once the abscess is properly drained, the prognosis
is excellent for the condition itself. The reason for the
abscess (other diseases the patient has) will determine
the overall outcome. If, on the other hand, the abscess
ruptures into neighboring areas or permits the infectious

quences are likely. Abscesses in and around the nasal
sinuses, face, ears, and scalp may work their way into the
brain. Abscesses within an abdominal organ such as the
liver may rupture into the abdominal cavity. In either
case, the result is life threatening. Blood poisoningis a
term commonly used to describe an infection that has
spilled into the blood stream and spread throughout the
body from a localized origin. Blood poisoning, known to
physicians as septicemia, is also life threatening.
Of special note, abscesses in the hand are more seri-
ous than they might appear. Due to the intricate structure
and the overriding importance of the hand, any hand
infection must be treated promptly and competently.
Prevention
Infections that are treated early with heat (if superfi-
cial) or antibiotics will often resolve without the forma-
tion of an abscess. It is even better to avoid infections
altogether by taking prompt care of open injuries, partic-
ularly puncture wounds. Bites are the most dangerous of
all, even more so because they often occur on the hand.

drainage
Abscess incision & drainage
Definition
An infected skin nodule that contains pus may need to
be drained via a cut if it does not respond to antibiotics.
This allows the pus to escape, and the infection to heal.
Purpose
An abscessis a pus-filled sore, usually caused by a
bacterial infection. The pus is made up of both live and
dead organisms and destroyed tissue from the white
blood cells that were carried to the area to fight the infec-	tion. Abscesses are often found in the soft tissue under	the skin, such as the armpit or the groin. However, they	may develop in any organ, and are commonly found in	the breast and gums. Abscesses are far more serious and	call for more specific treatment if they are located in	deep organs such as the lung, liver or brain.
Because the lining of the abscess cavity tends to
interfere with the amount of the drug that can penetrate
the source of infection from the blood, the cavity itself
may require draining. Once an abscess has fully formed,
it often does not respond to antibiotics. Even if the
antibiotic does penetrate into the abscess, it doesn’t func-
tion as well in that environment.
Precautions
An abscess can usually be diagnosed visually, al-
though an imaging technique such as a computed tomog-
raphy scan may be used to confirm the extent of the
abscess before drainage. Such procedures may also be
needed to localize internal abscesses, such as those in the
abdominal cavity or brain.

A doctor will cut into the lining of the abscess, allow-
ing the pus to escape either through a drainage tube or by
leaving the cavity open to the skin. How big the incision
is depends on how quickly the pus is encountered.
Once the abscess is opened, the doctor will clean
and irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline. If it is not
too large or deep, the doctor may simply pack the
abscess wound with gauze for 24–48 hours to absorb the
pus and discharge.
If it is a deeper abscess, the doctor may insert a
drainage tube after cleaning out the wound. Once the tube is
in place, the surgeon closes the incision with simple stitch-
es, and applies a sterile dressing. Drainage is maintained for
several days to help prevent the abscess from reforming.
Preparation
The skin over the abscess will be cleansed by swab-
bing gently with an antiseptic solution.
Aftercare
Much of the painaround the abscess will be gone
after the surgery. Healing is usually very fast. After the
tube is taken out, antibiotics may be continued for sever-
al days. Applying heat and keeping the affected area ele-
vated may help relieve inflammation.
Risks
If there is any scarring, it is likely to become much
less noticeable as time goes on, and eventually almost
invisible. Occasionally, an abscess within a vital organ
(such as the brain) damages enough surrounding tissue
that there is some permanent loss of normal function.
Normal results
Most abscesses heal after drainage alone; others
require drainage and antibiotic drug treatment.

Abuse
Definition
Abuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-
ous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive and
wrongful misuse of anything. There are several major types
of abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,
substance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.
Description
Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by
an other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-
ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.
The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in
bruises,burns,poisoning, broken bones, and internal
hemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily
occurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-
lence. It is estimated that approximately three million
children witness domestic violence every year.
Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior
between an adult and child or between two children, one
of whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual
behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-
tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also
include exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-
tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.
Pornographic photography is also used in sexual
abuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%
male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care
settings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a
female with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-
fathers is five times more common than with biological
fathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or
fathers is the most common form of incest.
Sexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The
legal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-
tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-
tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-
tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:
• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use
of drugs).

rational judgment.
• if the victim is below the legal age established for con-
sent.
Substance abuse is an abnormal pattern of substance
usage leading to significant distress or impairment. The
criteria include one or more of the following occurring
within a 12-month period:
• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill
obligations at home, work, or school.
• using substance in situations that are physically danger-
ous (i.e., while driving).
• recurrent substance-related legal problems.
• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-
sonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-
cant other).
Abuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly
as a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level of
dependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abuse
can be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delaying
or not reporting the need for advanced medical care.
Elderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (money
or possessions taken away) and abandonment.
Emotional abuse generally continues even after phys-
ical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personally
tailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-
it a provoked response.
Causes and symptoms
Children who have been abused usually have a variety
of symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, and
psychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-
cally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,
depressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, they
exhibit fear,anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychological
problems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic
stressdisorder. Physically abused children may complain
of physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They
may also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-
dren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual
behavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.
Adolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,
and—in some situations—homosexual contact.
Physical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately
lead to death. Approximately 50% of women murdered
in the United States were killed by a former or current
male partner. Approximately one-third of emergency
room consultations by women were prompted due to
domestic violence. Female victims who are married also
have a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-

ments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.
ness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).
Physical abuse or rape can also occur between married
persons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-
ally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and
debase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-
lence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-
ually assaulted persons were also physically abused in the
form of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with
a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who are
hurt and humiliated tend to physical assault persons
whom they are intimately involved with, such as spouses
and/or children. Males who assault a female tend to have
experienced or witnessed violence during childhood.
They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,
and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directed
against children. Jealous males tend to monitor the
women’s movements and whereabouts and to isolate
other sources of protection and support. They interpret
their behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-
ment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-
ing control. Males may also use aggression against
females in an effort to control and intimidate partners.
Abuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly
community. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-
taker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-
ing behavioral changes in the elderly person when the
caretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can be
possible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,
inconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack of
hygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.
Diagnosis
Children who are victims of domestic violence are
frequently injured attempting to protect their mother
from an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspection
or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also be
evident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises or
self report.
Sexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be
diagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can be
assessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator.
Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth,
rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis-
easesmay be performed.

Abuse
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 17  Elderly abuse can be suspected if the elderly patient
demonstrates a fear from the caretaker. Additionally,
elderly abuse can be suspected if there are signs indicat-
ing intentional delay of required medical care or a
change in medical status.
Substance abuse can be suspected in a person who
continues to indulge in their drug of choice despite recur-
rent negative consequences. The diagnosis can be made
after administration of a comprehensive bio-psycho-
social exam and standardized chemical abuse assess-
ments by a therapist.
Treatment
Children who are victims of physical or sexual abuse
typically require psychological support and medical atten-
tion. A complaint may be filed with the local family social
services that will initiate investigations. The authorities
will usually follow up the allegation or offense. Children
may also be referred for psychological evaluation and/or
treatment. The victim may be placed in foster care pending
the investigation outcome. The police may also investigate
physical and sexual abuse of an adult. The victim may
require immediate medical care and long-term psychologi-
cal treatment. It is common for children to be adversely
affected by domestic violence situations and the local fam-
ily services agency may be involved.
Substance abusers should elect treatment, either inpa-
tient or outpatient, depending on severity of addiction.
Long term treatment and/or medications may be utilized to
assist in abstinence. The patient should be encouraged to
participate in community centered support groups.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the diagnosis. Usually
victims of physical and sexual abuse require therapy to
deal with emotional distress associated with the incident.
Perpetrators require further psychological evaluation and
treatment. Victims of abuse may have a variety of emo-
tional problems including depression, acts of suicide, or
anxiety. Children of sexual abuse may as adults enter
abusive relationships or have problems with intimacy.
The substance abuser may experience relapses, since the
cardinal feature of all addictive disorders is a tendency to
return to symptoms. Elderly patients may suffer from
further medical problems and/or anxiety, and in some
cases neglect may precipitate death.
Prevention
Prevention programs are geared to education and
awareness. Detection of initial symptoms or characteris-
tic behaviors may assist in some situations. In some
cases treatment may be sought before incident. The pro-
fessional treating the abused persons must develop a
clear sense of the relationship dynamics and the chances
for continued harm.

Acetaminophen
Definition
Acetaminophen is a medicine used to relieve pain
and reduce fever.
Purpose
Acetaminophen is used to relieve many kinds of
minor aches and pains—headaches, muscle aches, back-
aches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, and the
aches and pains that often accompany colds.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 218
Acetaminophen
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 18  Description
This drug is available without a prescription. Aceta-
minophen—or APAP—is sold under various brand
names, including Tylenol, Panadol,AspirinFree Anacin,
and Bayer Select Maximum Strength HeadachePain
Relief Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, and
sinus medicines also contain acetaminophen. Check the
ingredients listed on the container to see if aceta-
minophen is included in the product.
Studies have shown that acetaminophen relieves pain
and reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differences
between these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophen
is less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However,
unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red-
ness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults and children age 12 and
over is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No more
than 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.
Because the drug can potentially harm the liver, people
who drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-
erably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the
drug completely.
For children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-
300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physician
for dosages for children under age 6 years.
Precautions
Never take more than the recommended dosage of
acetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician or
dentist.
Patients should not use acetaminophen for more than
10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for more
than 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by a
physician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they get
worse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three or
more alcoholic beverages a day should check with a
physician before using this drug and should never take
more than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam-
age exists from combining large amounts of alcohol and
acetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liver
disease or liver infections should also consult with a
physician before using the drug. So should women who
are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Smokingcigarettes may interfere with the effective-
ness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higher
doses of the medicine, but should not take more than the
recommended daily dosage unless told by a physician to
do so.
KEY TERMS
Arthritis—Inflammation of the joints. The condi-
tion causes pain and swelling.
Fatigue—Physical or mental weariness.
Inflammation—A response to irritation, infection,
or injury, resulting in pain, redness, and swelling.
Many drugs can interact with one another. Consult
a physician or pharmacist before combining aceta-
minophen with any other medicine. Do not use two
different acetaminophen-containing products at the
same time.
Acetaminophen interferes with the results of some
medical tests. Before having medical tests done, check to
see whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results.
Avoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may be
necessary.
Side effects
Acetaminophen causes few side effects. The most
common one is lightheadedness. Some people may
experience trembling and pain in the side or the lower
back. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, but
they are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such as
a rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after taking
acetaminophen should stop taking the drug and get
immediate medical attention. Other rare side effects
include yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-
ing, weakness,fatigue, bloody or black stools, bloody
or cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amount
of urine.
Overdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,
vomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large overdoses
can cause liver damage. In case of an overdose, get
immediate medical attention.
Interactions
Acetaminophen may interact with a variety of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Among the drugs that may interact with
acetaminophen are alcohol,nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs(NSAIDs) such as Motrin,oral contra-
ceptives, the antiseizure drug phenytoin (Dilantin), the
blood-thinning drug warfarin (Coumadin), the choles-
terol-lowering drug cholestyramine (Questran), the
antibiotic Isoniazid, and zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT).

Achalasia
Definition
Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that pre-
vents normal swallowing.
Description
Achalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that carries
swallowed food from the back of the throat down into the
stomach. A ring of muscle called the lower esophageal
sphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance to
the stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contracted
to close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, the
contents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-
gus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-
tate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as
heartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of
esophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushes
food along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the
esophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-
ach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” the
esophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-
sis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Achalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve
cells that normally signal the brain to relax the
esophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-
ation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-
tion is suspected.
Symptoms
Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-
mon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-
ally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,
often feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. The
person has chest painthat is often mistaken for angina
pectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belching
are common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other	symptoms may include nighttime coughor recurrent
pneumoniacaused by food passing into the lower airways.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical
history. The history should focus on the timing of symp-
toms and on eliminating other medical conditions that
may cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnose
achalasia include:
• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is
passed into the esophagus to measure the pressure
exerted by the esophageal sphincter.
• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to
act as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of
the esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to
see its constriction at the sphincter.
• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a
light source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is
used to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.
This test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms
like those of achalasia. Cancerof the esophagus occurs
as a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.
Treatment
The first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-
tion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-
loon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and
inflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effective
in about 70% of patients.
Three other treatments are used for achalasia when
balloon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.
• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,
botulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it to
relax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.
• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the
sphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.
Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with the
development of techniques allowing very small abdom-
inal incisions.
• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,
reduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-
vides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as long
as two years.
Prognosis
Most patients with achalasia can be treated effective-
ly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unless
esophageal carcinoma develops.

Description
Achondroplasia is one of a number of chondodystro-
phies, in which the development of cartilage, and there-
fore, bone is disturbed. The disorder appears in approxi-
mately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia is
usually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristic
appearance of the newborn.
Normal bone growth depends on the production of
cartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-
um is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-
en and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities
of this process prevent the bones (especially those in
the limbs) from growing as long as they normally
should, at the same time allowing the bones to become
abnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the
body and the skull are mostly not affected, although the
opening from the skull through which the spinal cord
passes (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-
mal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which the
spinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes
increasingly and abnormally small down the length of
the spine.
Causes and symptoms
Achondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a
dominant trait, meaning that anybody with the genetic
defect will display all the symptoms of the disorder. A
parent with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing it

passed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of cases
occur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-
ingly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one of
only a few defects known to increase in frequency with
increasing age of the father (many genetic defects are
linked to increased age of the mother).
People with achondroplasia have abnormally short
arms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as is
their head. The appearance of short limbs and normal
head size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.
The bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-
ance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-
mal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays an
overly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-
opment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because
the foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormally
narrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord or
nerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-
num may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between the
brain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulation
of too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Children
with achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious and
repeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear-
ing loss. The disease does not affect either mental capac-
ity, or reproductive ability.
KEY TERMS
Cartilage—A flexible, fibrous type of connective tis-
sue which serves as a base on which bone is built.
Foramen magnum—The opening at the base of the
skull, through which the spinal cord and the brain-
stem pass.
Hydrocephalus—An abnormal accumulation of
fluid within the brain. This accumulation can be
destructive by pressing on brain structures, and
damaging them.
Mutation—A new, permanent change in the struc-
ture of a gene, which can result in abnormal struc-
ture or function somewhere in the body.
Spinal canal—The opening that runs through the
center of the column of spinal bones (vertebrae),
and through which the spinal cord passes.
Vertebrae—The individual bones of the spinal col-
umn which are stacked on top of each other. There
is a hole in the center of each bone, through
which the spinal cord passes.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often made at birth due to the characteris-
tically short limbs, and the appearance of a large head. X-
ray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance to
the bones, with the bones of the limbs appearing short in
length, yet broad in width. A number of measurements of
the bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions.
Treatment
No treatment will reverse the defect present in achon-
droplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, with
abnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head. Treat-
ment of achondroplasia primarily addresses some of the
complications of the disorder, including problems due to
nerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, and
abnormal curves in the spine. Children with achondropla-
sia who develop middle ear infections (acute otitis
media) will require quick treatment with antibioticsand
careful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss.
Prognosis
Achondroplasia is a disease which causes consider-
able deformity. However, with careful attention paid to
the development of dangerous complications (nerve
compression, hydrocephalus), most people are in good
health, and can live a normal lifespan.
Prevention
The only form of prevention is through genetic
counseling, which could help parents assess their risk of
having a child with achondroplasia.

Acid phosphatase test
Definition
Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughout
the body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like all
enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-
tions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose
whether prostate cancerhas spread to other parts of the
body (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness of
treatment. The test has been largely supplanted by the
prostate specific antigen test (PSA).
Purpose
The male prostate gland has 100 times more acid
phosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostate
cancerspreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-
phatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads to
the bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who have
metastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphatase
levels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reduced
through treatment.
Tissues other than prostate have small amounts of
acid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,
and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissues
causes a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.
Acid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.
Rape investigations will often include testing for the
presence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid
phosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer has
metastasized.
Description
Laboratory testing measures the amount of acid
phosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine from
what tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it is
important to know if the increased acid phosphatase is
from the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase
from the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase
(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acid
phosphatase.
KEY TERMS
Enzyme—A substance needed to trigger specific
chemical reactions.
Metastasize—Spread to other parts of the body;
usually refers to cancer.
Prostate gland—A gland of the male reproductive
system.
Subtle differences between prostatic acid phos-
phatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues cause
them to react differently in the laboratory when mixed
with certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-
cal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-
static acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-
phatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-
ences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-
phatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usually
available the next day.
Preparation
This test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.
The patient should not have a rectal exam or prostate
massage for two to three days prior to the test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applying
pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops will
reduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will
relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and the
method used.
Abnormal results
The highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in
metastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the bone, such
as Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism; diseases of
blood cells, such as sickle cell diseaseor multiple
myeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher’s dis-
ease, will show moderately increased levels.
Certain medications can cause temporary increases
or decreases in acid phosphatase levels. Manipulation of
the prostate gland through massage, biopsy, or rectal
exam before a test can increase the level.

Acne
Definition
Acne is a common skin disease characterized by
pimples on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when the
pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin
cells, and bacteria.
Description
Acne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is
the most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 million
people in the United States. While acne can arise at any
age, it usually begins at pubertyand worsens during ado-
lescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some time
between the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of women
develop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.
The sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-
face. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural
moisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within
which they are found are called sebaceous follicles.
These follicles open onto the skin through pores. At
puberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)
cause the glands to produce too much sebum. When
excess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, a
hard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mild
noninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-
dones, whiteheads and blackheads.
Moderate and severe inflammatory types of acne
result after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-
bacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally lives on the
skin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens
and bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin and
white blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed
pimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when
deeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type of
acne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hard
swellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laid
down to replace damaged cells.
The most common sites of acne are the face, chest,
shoulders, and back since these are the parts of the body
where the most sebaceous follicles are found.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk
factors have been identified:
• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,
teenagers are more likely to develop acne.
• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it
more often than girls.
• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in
girls.
• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have
greater susceptibility to the disease.
• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-
tion, during pregnancy, and menopause.
• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause
flare-ups.
• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including
tranquilizers, antidepressants,antibiotics,oral contra-
ceptives, and anabolic steroids.
• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or
picking at pimples will make them worse.
• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen
acne.
• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,
and sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.
•Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.
Acne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed
lesions may cause pain, tenderness,itching, or swelling.
The most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-
tive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Some
people, especially teenagers, become emotionally upset
about their condition, and have problems forming rela-
tionships or keeping jobs.
Diagnosis
Acne patients are often treated by family doctors.
Complicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin

treats diseases of the body’s endocrine (hormones and
glands) system.
Acne has a characteristic appearance and is not diffi-
cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medical
history, including questions about skin care, diet, factors
causing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment.
Physical examinationincludes the face, upper neck,
chest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Under
good lighting, the doctor determines what types and how
many blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,
whether they are deep or superficial, and whether there is
scarring or skin discoloration.
In teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,
nose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appear
towards the outer part of the face. Adult women may
have acne on their chins and around their mouths. The
elderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on the
upper cheeks and skin around the eyes.
Laboratory tests are not done unless the patient
appears to have a hormonal disorder or other medical
problem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests may
be ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-
nosing and treating acne.
Treatment
Acne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-
tion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria with
topical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choice
depends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, or
severe.
Drugs
TOPICAL DRUGS.Treatment for mild noninflamma-
tory acne consists of reducing the formation of new
comedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-
palene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effective
because it increases turnover (deathand replacement) of
skin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topical
antibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.
Improvement is usually seen in two to four weeks.
Topical medications are available as cream, gel,
lotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. They
include antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-
thromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline
(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugs
and open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin
(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-
nol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics and
antibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid
(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-
mycin), are also used. These drugs may be used for
months to years to achieve disease control.
After washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied
alone or in combination, once or twice a day over the
entire affected area of skin. Possible side effects include
mild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased
sensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.
ORAL DRUGS.Oral antibiotics are taken daily for
two to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,
erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-
damycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole
(Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include allergic
reactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections,dizzi-
ness, and tooth discoloration.
The goal of treating moderate acne is to decrease
inflammation and prevent new comedone formation. One
effective treatment is topical tretinoin along with a topical

oxide and erythromycin is also very effective. Improve-
ment is normally seen within four to six weeks, but treat-
ment is maintained for at least two to four months.
A drug reserved for the treatment of severe acne, oral
isotretinoin (Accutane), reduces sebum production and
cell stickiness. It is the treatment of choice for severe acne
with cysts and nodules, and is used with or without topical
or oral antibiotics. Taken for four to five months, it pro-
vides long-term disease control in up to 60% of patients. If
the acne reappears, another course of isotretinoin may be
needed by about 20% of patients, while another 20% may
do well with topical drugs or oral antibiotics. Side effects
include temporary worsening of the acne, dry skin, nose-
bleeds, vision disorders, and elevated liver enzymes, blood
fats and cholesterol. This drug must not be taken during
pregnancy since it causes birth defects.

tion, are used to treat women who are unresponsive to
other therapies. Certain types of oral contraceptives (for

(estrogens) reduce hormone activity in the ovaries. Other
drugs, for example, spironolactone and corticosteroids,
reduce hormone activity in the adrenal glands. Improve-
ment may take up to four months.
Oral corticosteroids, or anti-inflammatory drugs, are
the treatment of choice for an extremely severe, but rare
type of destructive inflammatory acne called acne fulmi-
nans, found mostly in adolescent males. Acne congloba-
ta, a more common form of severe inflammation, is char-
acterized by numerous, deep, inflammatory nodules that
heal with scarring. It is treated with oral isotretinoin and
corticosteroids.
Other treatments
Several surgical or medical treatments are available
to alleviate acne or the resulting scars:
• Comedone extraction. The comedo is removed from the
pore with a special tool.
• Chemical peels. Glycolic acid is applied to peel off the
top layer of skin to reduce scarring.
• Dermabrasion. The affected skin is frozen with a chem-
ical spray, and removed by brushing or planing.
• Punch grafting. Deep scars are excised and the area
repaired with small skin grafts.
• Intralesional injection. Corticosteroids are injected
directly into inflamed pimples.
• Collagen injection. Shallow scars are elevated by colla-
gen (protein) injections.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for acne focus on proper
cleansing to keep the skin oil-free; eating a well-bal-
anced diet high in fiber, zinc, and raw foods; and avoid-
ing alcohol, dairy products,smoking,caffeine,
sugar,processed foods, and foods high in iodine, such as
salt. Supplementation with herbs such as burdock root
(Arctium lappa), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and
milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and with nutrients such
as essential fatty acids, vitamin B complex, zinc, vitamin
A, and chromium is also recommended. Chinese herbal
remedies used for acne include cnidium seed (Cnidium
monnieri) and honeysuckle flower (Lonicera japonica).
Wholistic physicians or nutritionists can recommend the
proper amounts of these herbs.
Prognosis
Acne is not curable, although long-term control is
achieved in up to 60% of patients treated with

with improvement taking two or more months. Acne
tends to reappear when treatment stops, but spontaneous-
ly improves over time. Inflammatory acne may leave
scars that require further treatment.
Prevention
There are no sure ways to prevent acne, but the fol-
lowing steps may be taken to minimize flare-ups:
• gentle washing of affected areas once or twice every day
• avoid abrasive cleansers
• use noncomedogenic makeup and moisturizers
• shampoo often and wear hair off face
• eat a well-balanced diet, avoiding foods that trigger
flare-ups
• unless told otherwise, give dry pimples a limited
amount of sun exposur
• do not pick or squeeze blemishes
• reduce stress

Acoustic neuroma
Definition
An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor involving
cells of the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibulo-
cochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve).
Description
The vestibulocochlear nerve extends from the inner
ear to the brain and is made up of a vestibular branch,
often called the vestibular nerve, and a cochlear branch,
called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular and cochlear
nerves lie next to one another. They also run along side
other cranial nerves. People possess two of each type of
vestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the left
ear and one that extends from the right ear.
The vestibular nerve transmits information concern-
ing balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlear
nerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibular
nerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called a
myelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-
times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumor
is an abnormal growth of tissue that results from the
uncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are often
called vestibular schwannomas because they are tumors
that arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds the
vestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered
benign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread to
other parts of the body. They can occur anywhere along
the vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where the
vestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canal
that connects the brain and the inner ear.
An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-
lar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumor
is a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumor
arises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acoustic
neuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilat-
eral acoustic neuromas occur as part of a hereditary con-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	27
Acoustic neuroma
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 27  dition called NeurofibromatosisType 2 (NF2). A person
with NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing
acoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.
Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can
take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remain
so small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the
acoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-
tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo and
balance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows large
enough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing
lossand a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu-
ally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-
ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the region
and cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-
ening if it becomes large enough to press against and
interfere with the functioning of the brain.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
An acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or
absence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in a
nerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes in
every cell of their body including their nerve cells. One
NF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother and
one NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of the
father. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-
vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-
ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.
Only one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is
necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-
ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing in
one of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nerve
then an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-
lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genes
become spontaneously changed or missing. Someone
with a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developed
spontaneously is not at increased risk for having children
with an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-
romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also
possible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be
caused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-
venting the formation of tumors.
Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is
affected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person with
NF2 is typically born with one unchanged and one
changed or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.
Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother or
father. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously when
the egg and sperm come together to form the first cell of
the baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%
chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.
A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-
ma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-
taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath
cells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 often
develop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The mean
age of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years of
age versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-
mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acoustic
neuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk for
developing cataractsand tumors in other nerve cells.
Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are
not affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,
only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear
nerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-
al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve a
number of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-
one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-
roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and
other family members diagnosed with NF2 probably is
affected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acoustic
neuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts
and other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the
other hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral
acoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family history
of NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.
Symptoms
Small acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with
the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The most
common first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing
loss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-
nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report
difficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceiving
the tone of a musical instrument or sound even when their
hearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases the
hearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually over
time until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-
mately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.
Acoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of
the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve and
van cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent of
small tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, which
is characterized by dizzinessor a whirling sensation.
Larger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigo
but more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,
which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-
al feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of people
with an acoustic neuroma.
As the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-
ing cranial nerves. Compression of the fifth cranial nerve
can result in facial painand or numbness. Compression of
the seventh cranial nerve can cause spasms, weakness or

symptom but can result when the 6th cranial nerve is affect-
ed. Swallowing and/or speaking difficulties can occur if the
tumor presses against the 9th, 10th, or 12th cranial nerves.
If left untreated, the tumor can become large enough
to press against and affect the functioning of the brain
stem. The brain stem is the stalk like portion of the brain
that joins the spinal cord to the cerebrum, the thinking and
reasoning part of the brain. Different parts of the brain-
stem have different functions such as the control of breath-
ing and muscle coordination. Large tumors that impact the
brain stem can result in headaches, walking difficulties
(gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of the
muscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic neuro-
ma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can cause nau-
sea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually coma, respiratory
difficulties and death. In the vast majority of cases, how-
ever, the tumor is discovered and treated long before it is
large enough to cause such serious manifestations.

go hearing evaluations. Pure tone and speech audiometry

are two screening tests that are often used to evaluate hear-
ing. Pure tone audiometry tests to see how well someone
can hear tones of different volume and pitch and speech
audiometry tests to see how well someone can hear and
recognize speech. An acoustic neuroma is suspected in
someone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss that is
less severe in one ear than the other ear(asymmetrical).
Sometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR,
BAER) test is performed to help establish whether
someone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma. During
the ABR examination, a harmless electrical impulse is
passed from the inner ear to the brainstem. An acoustic
neuroma can interfere with the passage of this electri-
cal impulse and this interference can, sometimes be
identified through the ABR evaluation. A normal ABR
examination does not rule out the possibility of an
acoustic neuroma. An abnormal ABR examination
increases the likelihood that an acoustic neuroma is
present but other tests are necessary to confirm the
presence of a tumor.
If an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then
magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is usually per-
formed. The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that is

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 29  able to detect nearly 100% of acoustic neuromas. Com-
puterized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is unable to
identify smaller tumors; but it can be used when an
acoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI evaluation
cannot be performed.
Once an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evalua-
tion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genet-
ic counselor may be recommended. The purpose of this
evaluation is to obtain a detailed family history and
check for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected
then DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testing
involves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-
tine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-
ed with NF2.
Treatment
The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma
are surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician
and patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-
ent options prior to making a decision about treatment.
The patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumor
size, and tumor location should be considered.
Microsurgery
The surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the
most common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In most
cases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. If
the tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yet
there is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then only
part of the tumor may be removed. During the procedure
the tumor is removed under microscopic guidance and
general anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranial
nerves is done during the procedure so that damage to
these nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearing
is a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take
place during the surgery.
Most people stay in the hospital four to seven days
following the surgery. Total recovery usually takes four
to six weeks. Most people experience fatigueand head
discomfort following the surgery. Problems with balance
and head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-
tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at most
major centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-
ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In most
cases these complications can be managed successfully
and do not result in long term medical problems. Surgery
brings with it a risk of stroke, damage to the brain stem,
infection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-
nial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from
the surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to
five years following the surgery because of possible
regrowth of the tumor.
Stereotactic Radiation therapy
During stereotactic radiation therapy, also called
radiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-
tion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-
ation is administered in a single large dose, under local
anesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This
results in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but little
radiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-
ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.
The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or at
least limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-
cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.
Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of the
patient is therefore recommended.
Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can
sometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can
also cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, which
can result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis
of the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms are
temporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-
tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This type
of treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-
ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-
disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.
Observation
Acoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in
some cases they will stop growing and even become
smaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-
priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-
odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.
Long-term observation may be appropriate for example
in an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma and
few symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-
ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acoustic
neuroma that was detected through an evaluation for
another medical problem. Observation may also be sug-
gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the only
hearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-
ger of an observational approach is that as the tumor
grows larger it can become more difficult to treat.
Prognosis
The prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic
neuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-
nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Long
term hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-
mon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth of
the tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiation
therapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno-
sis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increased
risk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors.

Acrocyanosis
Definition
Acrocyanosis is a decrease in the amount of oxygen
delivered to the extremities. The hands and feet turn blue
because of the lack of oxygen. Decreased blood supply
to the affected areas is caused by constriction or spasm of
small blood vessels.
Description
Acrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constric-
tion or narrowing of small blood vessels in the skin of affect-
ed patients. The spasm of the blood vessels decreases the
amount of blood that passes through them, resulting in less
blood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands may
be the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue and
become cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.
Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms,
while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seen
mainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainly
cosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable,
with sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet.
Causes and symptoms
The sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasms
in the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to the
extremities. The spasms are a contraction of the muscles
in the walls of the blood vessels. The contraction
decreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels,
thereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through the
affected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis,
resulting in long term reduction of blood supply to the
hands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through the
blood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas does
not starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels near
the surface of the skin are affected.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by observation of the main clini-
cal symptoms, including persistently blue and sweaty
hands and/or feet and a lack of pain. Cooling the hands
increases the blueness, while warming the hands decreas-

mal, which rules out obstructive diseases. Raynaud’s dis-
easediffers from acrocyanosis in that it causes white and
red skin coloration phases, not just bluish discoloration.
Treatment
Acrocyanosis usually isn’t treated. Drugs that block
the uptake of calcium (calcium channel blockers) and
alpha-one antagonists reduce the symptoms in most
cases. Drugs that dilate blood vessels are only effective
some of the time. Sweating from the affected areas can
be profuse and require treatment. Surgery to cut the sym-
pathetic nerves is performed rarely.
Prognosis
Acrocyanosis is a benign and persistent disease. The
main concern of patients is cosmetic. Left untreated, the
disease does not worsen.

Acromegaly and gigantism
Definition
Acromegaly is a disorder in which the abnormal
release of a particular chemical from the pituitary gland
in the brain causes increased growth in bone and soft tis-
sue, as well as a variety of other disturbances throughout
the body. This chemical released from the pituitary gland
is called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability to

process and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also
altered. In children whose bony growth plates have not
closed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result in
exceptional growth of long bones. This variant is called
gigantism, with the additional bone growth causing
unusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bone
growth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.
Description
Acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in
approximately 50 out of every one million people (50/
1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Because
the symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-
sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are not
identified until they are middle aged.
Causes and symptoms
The pituitary is a small gland located at the base of
the brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases
certain chemicals, or hormones, which are important to
the functioning of other organs or body systems. The
pituitary hormones travel throughout the body and are
involved in a large number of activities, including the
regulation of growth and reproductive functions. The
cause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-
duction of GH.
Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives input
from another brain structure, the hypothalamus, located
at the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-
mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For
example, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-
releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitary
to release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should also
direct the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.
In acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH
and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,
GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growth
throughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stop
producing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormal
peaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the body
begin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability to
process and use nutrients like sugars and fats.
In acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin
to grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,
and forehead also grow, and facial features are described
as “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and because
the jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.
Due to swelling within the structures of the throat and
sinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-
low, and patients may develop loud snoring. Various hor-
monal changes cause symptoms such as:

• oily skin
• increased coarse body hair
• improper processing of sugars in the diet (and some-
times actual diabetes)
• high blood pressure
• increased calcium in the urine (sometimes leading to
kidney stones)
• increased risk of gallstones; and
• swelling of the thyroid gland
People with acromegaly have more skin tags, or out-
growths of tissue, than normal. This increase in skin tags
is also associated with the development of growths,
called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-
ally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often
suffer from headaches and arthritis. The various
swellings and enlargements throughout the body may
press on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling or
burning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.
The most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of
patients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-
in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors
are the source of the abnormal release of GH. As these
tumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within the
brain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-
noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering
with the release of other hormones. These disruptions may
be responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of
women, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,
and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. In
rare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-
tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production of
GH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,
thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggers
production of an abnormal quantity of GH.
Diagnosis
Because acromegaly produces slow changes over
time, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, the
characteristic coarsening of the facial features is often
not recognized by family members, friends, or long-time
family physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by a
new physician who sees the patient for the first time and
is struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.
Comparing old photographs from a number of different
time periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.
Because the quantity of GH produced varies widely
under normal conditions, demonstrating high levels of
GH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of
acromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an
increase of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are
useful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-
preted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 vary
when the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder-
ly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show a
decrease in GH production when given a large dose of
sugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not show
this decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-
duction. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is useful
for viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locating
an adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the search
for a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.
Treatment
The first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of
all or part of the pituitary adenoma. Removal requires
surgery, usually performed by entering the skull through
the nose. While this surgery can cause rapid improvement
of many acromegaly symptoms, most patients will also

while octreotide (Sandostatin) must be injected every eight
hours. Both of these medications are helpful in reducing
GH production, but must often be taken for life and pro-

Without treatment, patients with acromegaly will
most likely die early because of the disease’s effects on the
heart, lungs, brain, or due to the development of cancerin
the large intestine. With treatment, however, a patient with
acromegaly may be able to live a normal lifespan.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 34  Description
Actinomycosis is a relatively rare infection occurring
in one out of 300,000(1/300,000) people per year. It is
characterized by the presence of a lump or mass that often
forms, draining sinus tracts to the skin surface. Fifty per-
cent of actinomycosis cases are of the head and neck region
(also called “lumpy jaw” and “cervicofacial actinomyco-
sis”), 15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, and
the rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are three
times more likely to develop actinomycosis than women.
Causes and symptoms
Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium
Actinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally present
in the mouth but can cause disease if it enters tissues fol-
lowing an injury. Actinomyces israeliiis an anaerobic
bacterium which means it dislikes oxygen but grows very
well in deep tissues where oxygen levels are low. Tooth
extraction, tooth disease,root canal treatment,jaw
surgery, or poor dental hygiene can allow Actinomyces
israeliito cause an infection in the head and neck region.
The main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis is
the presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The lump
may or may not be red. Feveroccurs in some cases.
Diagnosis
Cervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by a fam-
ily doctor or dentist and the patient may be referred to an oral
surgeon or infectious disease specialist. The diagnosis of
actinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of a
red lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly
suggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history of
tooth extraction or signs of tooth decayor poor dental
hygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of the
fluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “sul-
fur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro-
duced by Actinomyces israelii. A biopsy may be performed to
remove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure can be
performed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office. Occa-
sionally the bacteria can be cultured from the sinus tract fluid
or from samples of the infected tissue.
Actinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, or
brain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptoms
often mimic those of other diseases. Actinomycosis of
the lungs or abdomen can resemble tuberculosisor can-
cer. x-ray results, the presence of draining sinus tracts,
and microscopic analysis and culturing of infected tissue
assist in the diagnosis.
Treatment
Actinomycosis is difficult to treat because of its
dense tissue location. Surgery is often required to drain

the lesion and/or to remove the site of infection. To kill
the bacteria, large doses of penicillin are given through a
vein daily for two to six weeks followed by six to twelve
months of penicillin taken by mouth. Tetracycline, clin-
damycin, or erythromycin may be used instead of peni-
cillin. The antibiotic therapy must be completed to insure
that the infection does not return. Hyperbaric oxygen
(oxygen under high pressure) therapy in combination
with the antibiotic therapy has been successful.
Prognosis
Complete recovery is achieved following treatment.
If left untreated, the infection may cause localized bone
destruction.
Prevention
The best prevention is to maintain good dental hy-
giene.

Acupressure is a form of touch therapy that utilizes
the principles of acupunctureand Chinese medicine. In
acupressure, the same points on the body are used as in
acupuncture, but are stimulated with finger pressure

used to relieve a variety of symptoms and pain.
Purpose
Acupressure massage performed by a therapist can be
very effective both as prevention and as a treatment for many
health conditions, including headaches, general aches and
pains, colds and flu, arthritis,allergies,asthma, nervous ten-
sion, menstrual cramps, sinus problems, sprains,tennis
elbow, and toothaches, among others. Unlike acupuncture
which requires a visit to a professional, acupressure can be
performed by a layperson. Acupressure techniques are fairly
easy to learn, and have been used to provide quick, cost-free,
and effective relief from many symptoms. Acupressure
points can also be stimulated to increase energy and feelings
of well-being, reduce stress, stimulate the immune system,
and alleviate sexual dysfunction.
Description
Origins
One of the oldest text of Chinese medicine is the
Huang Di, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal
Medicine, which may be at least 2,000 years old. Chi-
nese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure,
herbal remedies, diet,exercise, lifestyle changes, and
other remedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly all
of the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in the
West today, including acupuncture, acupressure,shiatsu,
and Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese
medicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-
pressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the
puncture woundsof Chinese warriors, noting that certain
points on the body created interesting results when stim-
ulated. The oldest known text specifically on acupunc-
ture points, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates
back to 282 
A.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form of
acupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined that
stimulating points on the body with massage and pres-
sure could be effective for treating certain problems.
Outside of Asian-American communities, Chinese
medicine remained virtually unknown in the United
States until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became the
first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s trip, jour-
nalists were amazed to observe major operations being
performed on patients without the use of anesthetics.
Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on,

trol pain. At that time, a famous columnist for the New
York Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery and
elected to use acupuncture for anesthesia. Later, he wrote
some convincing stories on its effectiveness. Despite
being neglected by mainstream medicine and the Ameri-
can Medical Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chi-
nese medicine became a central to alternative medicine
practitioners in the United States. Today, there are mil-
lions of patients who attest to its effectiveness, and near-
ly 9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.
Acupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese
medicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as by
massage therapists. Most massage schools in American
include acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork
programs. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu-
pressure, working with the same points on the body and
the same general principles, although it was developed
over centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology
is a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.
Jin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasing
number of practitioners in America that combines acu-
pressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian
theory, and meditation.
Acupressure and Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of
the universe, subject to laws and principles of harmony
and balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a
destinction as Western medicine does between mind and
body. The Chinese system believes that emotions and
mental states are every bit as influential on disease as
purely physical mechanisms, and considers factors like
work, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a
patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different
symbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While
Western medicine typically describes health as mainly
physical processes composed of chemical equations and
reactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi,
and the organ system to describe health and the body.
Everything in the universe has properties of yin and
yang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-
ward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,
male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.
Nothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-
ciples always interact and affect each other, although the
body and its organs can become imbalanced by having
either too much or too little of either.
Chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qior kiin Japan-
ese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy. It is found in
food, air, water, and sunlight, and it travels through the
body in channels called meridians. There are 12 major

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 37  meridians in the body that transport chi, corresponding to
the 12 main organs categorized by Chinese medicine.
Disease is viewed as an imbalance of the organs and
chi in the body. Chinese medicine has developed intri-
cate systems of how organs are related to physical and
mental symptoms, and it has devised corresponding
treatments using the meridian and pressure point net-
works that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu-
pressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblock
the circulation of chi, by activating very specific points,
called pressure points or acupoints. Acupressure seeks
to stimulate the points on the chi meridians that pass
close to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock and
manipulate with finger pressure.
Acupressure can be used as part of a Chinese
physician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther-
apy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill-
nesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a
patient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental and
emotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the
wrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and
observing the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get a
complete diagnosis of which organs and meridian
points are out of balance. When the imbalance is locat-
ed, the physician will recommend specific pressure
points for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure is
recommended, the patient might opt for a series of
treatments from a massage therapist.
In massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a
patient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massage
therapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as a
Chinese physician’s. In a massage therapy treatment, a
person usually lies down on a table or mat, with thin
clothing on. The acupressurist will gently feel and pal-
pate the abdomen and other parts of the body to deter-

mine energy imbalances. Then, the therapist will work
with different meridians throughout the body, depend-
ing on which organs are imbalanced in the abdomen.
The therapist will use different types of finger move-
ments and pressure on different acupoints, depending
on whether the chi needs to be increased or dispersed at
different points. The therapist observes and guides the
energy flow through the patient’s body throughout the
session. Sometimes, special herbs (Artemesia vulgaris
or moxa) may be placed on a point to warm it, a process
called moxibustion. A session of acupressure is general-
ly a very pleasant experience, and some people experi-
ence great benefit immediately. For more chronic con-
ditions, several sessions may be necessary to relieve
and improve conditions.
Acupressure massage usually costs from $30–70 per
hour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician or
acupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to a
visit to an allopathic physician if the practitioner is an
MD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and con-
sumers should be aware if their policies cover alternative
treatment, acupuncture, or massage therapy.
Self-treatment
Acupressure is easy to learn, and there are many
good books that illustrate the position of acupoints and
meridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as it can
be done anywhere, and it’s a good form of treatment for
spouses and partners to give to each other and for parents
to perform on children for minor conditions.
While giving self-treatment or performing acupressure
on another, a mental attitude of calmness and attention is
important, as one person’s energy can be used to help
another’s. Loose, thin clothing is recommended. There are
three general techniques for stimulating a pressure point.
• Tonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is done
by pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with a
firm, steady pressure, holding it for up to two minutes.
• Dispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked chi,
and the finger or thumb is moved in a circular motion or
slightly in and out of the point for two minutes.
• Calming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm to
cover the point and gently stroke the area for about two
minutes.
There are many pressure points that are easily found
and memorized to treat common ailments from headaches
to colds.
• For headaches, toothaches, sinus problems, and pain in
the upper body, the “LI4” point is recommended. It is
located in the web between the thumb and index finger,
on the back of the hand. Using the thumb and index fin-
ger of the other hand, apply a pinching pressure until

Acupressure
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 38  the point is felt, and hold it for two minutes. Pregnant
women should never press this point.
• To calm the nerves and stimulate digestion, find the
“CV12” point that is four thumb widths above the navel
in the center of the abdomen. Calm the point with the
palm, using gentle stroking for several minutes.
• To stimulate the immune system, find the “TH5” point
on the back of the forearm two thumb widths above the
wrist. Use a dispersing technique, or circular pressure
with the thumb or finger, for two minutes on each arm.
• For headaches, sinus congestion, and tension, locate the
“GB20” points at the base of the skull in the back of the
head, just behind the bones in back of the ears. Disperse
these points for two minutes with the fingers or thumbs.
Also find the “yintang” point, which is in the middle of
the forehead between the eyebrows. Disperse it with
gentle pressure for two minutes to clear the mind and to
relieve headaches.
Precautions
Acupressure is a safe technique, but it is not meant to
replace professional health care. A physician should
always be consulted when there are doubts about medical
conditions. If a condition is chronic, a professional should
be consulted; purely symptomatic treatment can exacer-
bate chronic conditions. Acupressure should not be
applied to open wounds, or where there is swelling and
inflammation. Areas of scar tissue, blisters,boils,rashes,
or varicose veinsshould be avoided. Finally, certain acu-
pressure points should not be stimulated on people with
high or low blood pressure and on pregnant women.
Research and general acceptance
In general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gain
acceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideas
very foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West-
ern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-
ble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-
tain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-
times too simple for scientists to believe.
Western scientists, in trying to account for the action
of acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of
the neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-
pedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominated
for the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject called
Cross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-
ils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measur-
ing devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the
body has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, and
that traditional acupressure meridians and points contained
amounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.
The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure
remain difficult to document in terms of the biochemical
processes involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-
ry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressure
and acupuncture. However, a body of research is growing
that verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and
acupuncture techniques in treating many problems and in
controlling pain.

Definition
Acupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment in
traditional Chinese medicine. It involves the use of
sharp, thin needles that are inserted in the body at very
specific points. This process is believed to adjust and alter
the body’s energy flow into healthier patterns, and is used
to treat a wide variety of illnesses and health conditions.
Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends
acupuncture as an effective treatment for over forty med-
ical problems, including allergies, respiratory conditions,
gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological problems, ner-
vous conditions, and disorders of the eyes, nose and
throat, and childhood illnesses, among others. Acupunc-
ture has been used in the treatment of alcoholismand
substance abuse. It is an effective and low-cost treatment
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	39
Acupuncture

like back injuries and arthritis. It has also been used to
supplement invasive Western treatments like chemother-
apyand surgery. Acupuncture is generally most effective
when used as prevention or before a health condition
becomes acute, but it has been used to help patients suf-
fering from cancerand AIDS. Acupuncture is limited in
treating conditions or traumas that require surgery or
emergency care (such as for broken bones).
Description
Origins
The original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei
Ching, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-
cine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old.
Thousands of books since then have been written on the
subject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies
spread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all of
the forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the West
today, including acupuncture,shiatsu,acupressuremas-
sage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots in
Chinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture devel-
oped when early Chinese physicians observed unpredict-
ed effects of puncture woundsin Chinese warriors. The
oldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic
of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 
A.D. Although acupunc-
ture is its best known technique, Chinese medicine tradi-
tionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestyle
changes and other means to treat patients.
In the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians
who had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,
but outside of Asian-American communities it remained
virtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon
became the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s
trip, journalists were amazed to observe major operations
being performed on patients without the use of anesthetics.
Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on with
only acupuncture needles inserted into them to control
pain. During that time, a famous columnist for the New
York Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery and
elected to use acupuncture instead of pain medication, and
he wrote some convincing stories on its effectiveness.
Today acupuncture is being practiced in all 50 states
by over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000 MDs includ-
ing it in their practices. Acupuncture has shown notable
success in treating many conditions, and over 15 million
Americans have used it as a therapy. Acupuncture, how-

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 40  ever, remains largely unsupported by the medical estab-
lishment. The American Medical Association has been
resistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts very
different from the Western scientific model.
Several forms of acupuncture are being used today in
America. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-
dles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-
tice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points only
on the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balance
internal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-
ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-
rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncture
based on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditional
Chinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.
Basic ideas of Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of
the universe, and subject to universal laws and principles
of harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not
draw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, between
mind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-
tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-
ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-
tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as
fundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.
Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols and
ideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-
icine typically describes health in terms of measurable
physical processes made up of chemical reactions, the
Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-
tem, and the five elements to describe health and the
body. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is
worthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.
YIN AND YANG.According to Chinese philosophy,
the universe and the body can be described by two sepa-
rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.
For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.
In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin
is passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and
yang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward
and yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever
completely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.
These two principles are always interacting, opposing,
and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-
cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow
the two to balance each other and exist harmoniously
together. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 41  of high blood pressure, the Chinese system would say
that the heart organ might have too much yang, and
would recommend methods either to reduce the yang or
to increase the yin of the heart, depending on the other
symptoms and organs in the body. Thus, acupuncture
therapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or
increase or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.
CHI.Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-
icine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi
is the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-
ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food
and sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force
that creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-
ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from
the food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and
quality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of
physical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels
through the body along channels called meridians.
THE ORGAN SYSTEM.In the Chinese system, there
are twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-
ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-
ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple
warmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each
organ has chi energy associated with it, and each organ
interacts with particular emotions on the mental level. As
there are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi
which can move through the body, and these move
through twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese
doctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptoms
are caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or more
organs, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from one

organ to another. Each organ has a different profile of
symptoms it can manifest.
THE FIVE ELEMENTS.Another basis of Chinese theo-
ry is that the world and body are made up of five main
elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-
ments are all interconnected, and each element either
generates or controls another element. For instance,
water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ
is associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese
system uses elements and organs to describe and treat
conditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with
water and the heart is associated with fire, and the two
organs are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-
ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire
problem in the heart, so treatment might be made by
acupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or
increase energy in the kidney system.
The Chinese have developed an intricate system of
how organs and elements are related to physical and
mental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-
ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Western
scientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.
For instance, Western medicine has observed that with
severe heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it
still does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,
this connection between the two organs has long been
established.
MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-
nese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organ
system or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy or
treatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate
harmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors like
emotions, external factors like the environment and
weather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, and
germs. However, infection is seen not as primarily a
problem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in the
energy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.
In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,
as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms and
balance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow
of chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-
en the body and prompt it to heal itself.
A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST.The first thing an
acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s
medical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-
tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-
view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient to
find further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the
pulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-
eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. From
this, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns of
symptoms which indicate which organs and areas are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 242
Acupuncture
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42  imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-
ist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or more
of the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-
ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used in
acupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-
quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an
individual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,
depending on which meridian points are chosen.
Acupuncture needles are always sterilized and
acupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-
tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels are
being treated. Some points barely go beyond superficial
layers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a
depth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-
ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinching
sensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-
riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-
turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight
electrical current through some of them. Moxibustionmay
be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa or
mugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncture
point or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-
ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-
times use cupping, during which small suction cups are
placed on meridian points to stimulate them.
How long the needles are inserted also varies. Some
patients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear
problems and provide tonification(strengthening of
health), while some other conditions might require nee-
dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit to
an acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The number
of visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with some
conditions improved in one or two sessions and others
requiring a series of six or more visits over the course of
weeks or months.
Costs for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether
the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MD
acupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-
its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement also
varies widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-
lations have been changing often. Some states authorize
Medicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, and
some states have mandated that general coverage pay for
acupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisions
for acupuncture in their individual policies.
Precautions
Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a
patient is in doubt about a medical condition, more than
one physician should be consulted. Also, a patient should
always feel comfortable and confident that their
acupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.
Research and general acceptance
Mainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-
ture; although more MDs are using it, the American Medical
Association does not recognize it as a specialty. The reason
for this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult to
scientifically understand or measure, such as the invisible
energy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting that
acupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that the
energy meridians are actually part of the nervous system and
that acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, or
natural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-
guity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to
show effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain to
alleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research
in acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-
tive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currently
funding research in the use of acupuncture for treating
depression and attention-deficit disorder.

Acute kidney failure
Definition
Acute kidney failure occurs when illness, infection,
or injury damages the kidneys. Temporarily, the kidneys
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	43
Acute kidney failure
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 43  cannot adequately remove fluids and wastes from the
body or maintain the proper level of certain kidney-regu-
lated chemicals in the bloodstream.
Description
The kidneys are the body’s natural filtration system.
They perform the critical task of processing approximate-
ly 200 quarts of fluid in the bloodstream every 24 hours.
Waste products like urea and toxins, along with excess
fluids, are removed from the bloodstream in the form of
urine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-
tioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin to
accumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in the
bloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure may
become puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,
and feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, and
they may experience fatigueand nausea.
Unlike chronic kidney failure, which is long term
and irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-
dition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typically
be reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to the
kidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently as
a complication of serious illness, like heart failure,liver
failure,dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleed-
ing (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-
tion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-
ease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.
Causes and symptoms
Acute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-
ent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions
fall into three main categories:prerenal,postrenal, and
intrarenalconditions.
Prerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but
can cause diminished kidney function. They are the most
common cause of acute renal failure, and include:
• dehydration
• hemorrhage
• septicemia, or sepsis
• heart failure
• liver failure
• burns
Postrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-
ing the urinary tract. These conditions include:
• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)
• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic
hypertrophy)
• bladder or pelvic tumors
•kidney stones(calculi)
Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or
direct injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:
• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)
• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney
problems
• drug abuse or overdose
• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain
painmedicines
• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the
kidney (glomerulonephritis)
• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)
Common symptoms of acute kidney failure include:
• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-
thropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red blood
cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking of
the kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-
ing to anemia.
• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may
cause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.
• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin
D, which helps the body absorb calcium and keeps
bones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones
may become brittle. In children, normal growth may be
stunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of high
phosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acid
may cause gout.
• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,
and around the eyes.
• frequent urination.
• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it
to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate
bleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,
or ureters.
• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.
• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of
fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. This
makes blood pressure rise.
• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the
presence of anemia may cause the patient to feel
exhausted.
• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,
accumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.
An increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.
• lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidney
problems (like kidney stones and other obstructions)
may have pain where the kidneys are located, in the
small of the back below the ribs.
• nausea. Urea in the gastric juices may cause upset
stomach.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 244
Acute kidney failure
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 44  Diagnosis
Kidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A nephrolo-
gist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-
sulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-
ment options. The patient that is suspected of having
acute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests to
determine the level of kidney function. A blood test will
assess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.
The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine
samples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour
period, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.
Determining the cause of kidney failure is critical to
proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-
sary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and if
the kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays,magnetic res-
onance imaging(MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),
ultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys
may be used to determine the cause of kidney failure and
level of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound
of the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.
Treatment
Treatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment
is directed to the underlying, primary medical condition
that has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions may
be treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,
diuretics, blood transfusion, or medications. Postrenal
conditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgery
and/or medication.
Frequently, patients in acute kidney failure require
hemodialysis,hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysisto fil-
ter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-
mary medical condition can be controlled.
Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s
blood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-
cuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up of
plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-
ficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors and
maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.
Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to
draw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s blood
leaves the body through the vein and travels through the
ECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.
During dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream
are carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytes
and other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,
chemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.
KEY TERMS
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product that
is formed in the liver and collects in the blood-
stream; patients with kidney failure have high
BUN levels.
Creatinine—A protein produced by muscle that
healthy kidneys filter out.
Extracorporeal—Outside of, or unrelated to, the
body.
Ischemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ or
tissue.
Nephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.
Radiocontrast agents—Dyes administered to a
patient for the purposes of a radiologic study.
Sepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.
Vasopressors—Medications that constrict the blood
vessels.
A dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,
depending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical
condition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a
week until acute kidney failure is reversed.
Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-
sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-
toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option in
these cases.
Hemofiltration
Hemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-
ment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-
tion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-
cally ill patients. These patients are typically very sick
and may have heart problems or circulatory problems.
They cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-
ysis. They also frequently need antibiotics,nutrition,
vasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein to
treat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration is
continuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients in
kidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.
Like hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A
hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer to
remove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, a
blood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. The
volume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-
tration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration rates
are slower and gentler on the circulatory system.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	45
Acute kidney failure
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 45  Hemofiltration treatment will generally be used until kid-
ney failure is reversed.
Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney
failure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis. In
peritoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’s
abdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexible
tube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted into
the patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter is
used to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Waste
products and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood-
stream into the dialysate solution. After a certain time
period, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from the
abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There are
three type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according to
treatment time and administration method.
Peritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option
for infants and children. Their small size can make vein
access difficult to maintain. It is not recommended for
patients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominal
defects (like a hernia) that might reduce the efficiency of
the treatment. It is also not recommended for patients
who suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of the
small pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).
Prognosis
Because many of the illnesses and underlying con-
ditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,
the prognosis for these patients many times is not good.
Studies have estimated overall deathrates for acute kid-
ney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, die
because of the primary disease that has caused the kid-
ney failure. These figures may also be misleading
because patients who experience kidney failure as a
result of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones or
dehydration) have an excellent chance of complete
recovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriate
treatment are key to patient recovery.
Up to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney
failure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They will
eventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure or
end-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-
term dialysis or kidney transplantationto replace their
lost renal functioning.
Prevention
Since acute kidney failure can be caused by many
things, prevention is difficult. Medications that may
impair kidney function should be given cautiously.
Patients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are
hospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care-
fully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat-
ments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid-
ney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrast
agents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution.

Acute lymphangitis
Definition
Acute lymphangitis is a bacterial infection in the
lymphatic vessels which is characterized by painful, red
streaks below the skin surface. This is a potentially seri-
ous infection which can rapidly spread to the blood-
stream and be fatal.
Description
Acute lymphangitis affects a critical member of the
immune system—the lymphatic system. Waste materials
from nearly every organ in the body drain into the lym-
phatic vessels and are filtered in small organs called
lymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as bacteria or viruses,
are processed in the lymph nodes to generate an immune
response to fight an infection.

through a cut, scratch, insect bite, surgical wound, or
other skin injury. Once the bacteria enter the lymphatic
system, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphatic
vessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vessel
becomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visible
below the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occurs
so rapidly that the immune system does not respond fast
enough to stop the infection.
If left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue
destruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,
painful lump called an abscessmay be formed in the
infected area. Cellulitis, a generalized infection of the
lower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-
ria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.
Lay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seen
in the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-
ous illness and may be fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Acute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-
terium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially danger-
ous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of the
heart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has been
called the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-
ria may also cause lymphangitis.
Although anyone can develop lymphangitis, some
people are more at risk. People who have had radical mas-
tectomy(removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a
leg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrent
lymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection on
the foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.
The characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis
are the wide, red streaks which travel from the site of
infection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,
swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin may
occur. The bacterial infection causes a feverof 100-104°F
(38°–40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscle
aches,headache, chills, and loss of appetite may be felt.
Diagnosis
If lymphangitis is suspected, the person should call
his or her doctor immediately or go to an emergency
room. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by the
family doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer-
gency room doctor. The painful, red streaks just below
the skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acute
lymphangitis. A sample of blood would be taken for cul-
ture to determine whether the bacteria have entered the
bloodstream. A biopsy (removal of a piece of infected
tissue) sample may be taken for culture to identify which

type of bacteria is causing the infection. Diagnosis is
immediate because it is based primarily on the symp-
toms. Most insurance policies should cover the expenses
for the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphangitis.
Treatment
Because of the serious nature of this infection, treat-
ment would begin immediately even before the bacterial
culture results were available. The only treatment for
acute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an
antibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growing
streptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly and
easily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may be
included in the treatment to kill any streptococci which
are not growing and are in a resting state. Alternatively, a
“broad spectrum” antibiotic may be used which would
kill many different kinds of bacteria.
Aspirinor other medications which reduce the pain
and the fever may also be given. Medications which
reduce any inflammation of the infected region may also
be provided. The patient is likely to be hospitalized to
administer the antibiotic and other medications and to
closely monitor his or her condition. Surgical drainage of
an abscess may be necessary.
Prognosis
Complete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatment
is begun at an early stage of the infection. However, if
untreated, acute lymphangitis can be a very serious and
even deadly disease. Acute lymphangitis that goes untreat-
ed can spread, causing tissue damage. Extensive tissue
damage would need to be repaired by plastic surgery.
Spread of the infection into the bloodstream could be fatal.
Prevention
Although acute lymphangitis can occur in anyone, good
hygiene and general health may help to prevent infections.

Acute poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis
Definition
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis
(APSGN) is an inflammation of the kidney tubules
(glomeruli) that filter waste products from the blood, fol-
lowing a streptococcal infection such as strep throat.
APSGN is also called postinfectious glomerulonephritis.
Description
APSGN develops after certain streptococcal bacteria
(group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) have infected the
skin or throat. Antigens from the dead streptococci
clump together with the antibodies that killed them.
These clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause the
tubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil-
ity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset of
APSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average two
weeks) after the streptococcal infection.
APSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting
about one of every 10,000 people, although four or five
times that many may actually be affected by it but show
no symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boys
between the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age.
Causes and symptoms
Frequent sore throats and a history of streptococcal
infection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN. Symp-
toms of APSGN include:
• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling (edema) initial-
ly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs
• low urine output (oliguria)
• blood in the urine (hematuria)
• protein in the urine (proteinuria)
• high blood pressure
• joint painor stiffness
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s
history, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-
tain laboratory tests. Urinalysisusually shows blood and
protein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-
nine (two waste products normally filtered out of the
blood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-
cating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensive
blood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirm
that a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. A
throat culturemay also show the presence of group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci.
Treatment
Treatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the
symptoms and prevent complications. Some patients are
advised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrict
fluid and salt intake. Antibioticsmay be prescribed to
kill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presence
is confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to help
control high blood pressure and diureticsmay be used to
reduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysisis
rarely needed.
Prognosis
Most children (up to 95%) fully recover from
APSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults (up
to 70%) also recover fully. In those who do not recover
fully, chronic or progressive problems of kidney function
may occur. Kidney failure may result in some patients.
Prevention
Receiving prompt treatment for streptococcal infec-
tionsmay prevent APSGN.

Acute stress disorder
Definition
Acute stressdisorder (ASD) is an anxietydisorder
characterized by a cluster of dissociative and anxiety
symptoms occurring within one month of a traumatic
event. (Dissociation is a psychological reaction to trauma
in which the mind tries to cope by “sealing off” some
features of the trauma from conscious awareness).
Description
Acute stress disorder is a new diagnostic category
that was introduced in 1994 to differentiate time-limited
reactions to trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).
Causes and symptoms
Acute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau-
ma, which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fear
and, usually, involves threats to life or serious injury to
oneself or others. Examples are rape, mugging, combat,
natural disasters, etc.
The symptoms of stress disorder include a combining
of one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms with
the avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event. Disso-
ciative symptoms include emotional detachment, tempo-
rary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.
Anxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-
der include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-
lems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com-
bination of the patient’s history and a physical examina-
tionto rule out diseases that can cause anxiety. The
KEY TERMS
Depersonalization—A dissociative symptom in
which the patient feels that his or her body is unre-
al, is changing, or is dissolving.
Derealization—A dissociative symptom in which
the external environment is perceived as unreal.
Dissociation—A reaction to trauma in which the
mind splits off certain aspects of the trauma from
conscious awareness. Dissociation can affect the
patient’s memory, sense of reality, and sense of
identity.
Trauma—In the context of ASD, a disastrous or
life-threatening event.
essential feature is a traumatic event within one month of
the onset of symptoms. Other diagnostic criteria include:
• The symptoms significantly interfere with normal
social or vocational functioning
• The symptoms last between two days and four weeks.
Treatment
Treatment for acute stress disorder usually includes
a combination of antidepressant medications and short-
term psychotherapy.
Alternative treatment
Acupuncturehas been recommended as a treatment
for acute stress disorder. Some other alternative
approaches, including meditation, breathing exercises,
and yoga, may be helpful when combined with short-
term psychotherapy. Homeopathic treatment and the use
of herbal medicine and flower essences also can help the
person with acute stress disorder rebalance on the physi-
cal, mental, and emotional levels.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery is influenced by the sever-
ity and duration of the trauma, the patient’s closeness to it,
and the patient’s previous level of functioning. Favorable
signs include a short time period between the trauma and
onset of symptoms, immediate treatment, and appropriate
social support. If the patient’s symptoms are severe
enough to interfere with normal life and have lasted longer
than one month, the diagnosis may be changed to PTSD.
If the symptoms have lasted longer than one month but are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	49
Acute stress disorder
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 49  not severe enough to meet the definition of PTSD, the
diagnosis may be changed to adjustment disorder.
Patients who do not receive treatment for acute
stress disorder are at increased risk for substance abuse
or major depressive disorders.
Prevention
Traumatic events cannot usually be foreseen and,
thus, cannot be prevented. However, in theory, profession-
al intervention soon after a major trauma might reduce the
likelihood or severity of ASD. In addition, some symp-
toms of acute stress disorder result from biochemical
changes in the central nervous system, muscles, and
digestive tract that are not subject to conscious control.

Addiction
Definition
Addiction is a dependence on a behavior or sub-
stance that a person is powerless to stop. The term has
been partially replaced by the word dependencefor sub-
stance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, to
include mood-altering behaviors or activities. Some	researchers speak of two types of addictions: substance	addictions (for example,alcoholism, drug abuse, and
smoking); and process addictions (for example, gam-
bling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).
There is a growing recognition that many addicts, such as
polydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-
stance or process.
Description
Addiction is one of the most costly public health
problems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-
drome, which means that it increases in severity over
time unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterized
by frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.
Substance abusers often make repeated attempts to quit
before they are successful.
In 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in the
United States exceeded $414 billion, with health care
costs attributed to substance abuse estimated at more
than $114 billion.
By eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed
alcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% have
smoked marijuana. Compared to females, males are
almost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearly
one and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more of
cigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuana
weekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-
ferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-
co,cocaineand heavy drinking appears to have remained
stable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.
In 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the
age of 12 used prescription painrelievers, sedatives, and
stimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.
In the United States, 25% of the population regularly
uses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times as
many people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-
bined. According to 1998 data from the World Health
Organization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwide
and 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,
in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years are
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which has
been implicated in sudden infant death syndrome,low
birth weight,asthma, middle ear disease,pneumonia,
cough, and upper respiratory infection.
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa,bulim-
ia nervosa, and binge eating, affect over five million
American women and men. Fifteen percent of young
women have substantially disordered attitudes toward
eating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women die
each year from anorexia nervosa.

Addiction
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50  A 1997 Harvard study found that an estimated 15.4
million Americans suffered from a gambling addiction.
Over half that number (7.9 million) were adolescents.
Causes and symptoms
Addiction to substances results from the interaction
of several factors:
Drug chemistry
Some substances are more addictive than others,
either because they produce a rapid and intense change in
mood; or because they produce painful withdrawal
symptoms when stopped suddenly.
Genetic factor
Some people appear to be more vulnerable to addic-
tion because their body chemistry increases their sensi-
tivity to drugs. Some forms of substance abuse and
dependenceseem to run in families; and this may be the
result of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-
ences, or a combination of both.
Brain structure and function
Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain
structure and function in fundamental and long-lasting
ways. Addiction comes about through an array of
changes in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-
ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lasting
brain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-
nitive and emotional functioning that characterize
addicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.
Although the causes of addiction remain the subject of
ongoing debate and research, many experts now consider
addiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused by
persistent changes in brain structure and function. How-
ever, having this brain disease does not absolve the
addict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it does
explain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs by
sheer force of will alone.
Social learning
Social learning is considered the most important sin-
gle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-
ly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or media
influence.
Availability
Inexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, or
drugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.
Individual development
Before the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality
was used to explain the development of addiction. The
addictive personality was described as escapist, impul-
sive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-
tered. Many doctors now believe that these character
traits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,
rather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.
Diagnosis
In addition to a preoccupation with using and
acquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-
tion is based on five criteria:
• loss of willpower
• harmful consequences
• unmanageable lifestyle
• tolerance or escalation of use
• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting

Addiction—Dependence on a habit-forming sub-
stance or behavior that the person is powerless to
stop.
Addictive personality—A concept that was for-
merly used to explain addiction as the result of
pre-existing character defects in individuals.
Process addiction—Addiction to certain mood-
altering behaviors, such as eating disorders, gam-
bling, sexual activity, overwork, and shopping.
Tolerance—A condition in which an addict needs
higher doses of a substance to achieve the same
effect previously achieved with a lower dose.
Withdrawal—The unpleasant, sometimes life-
threatening physiological changes that occur, due
to the discontinuation of use of some drugs after
prolonged, regular use.
Treatment
Treatment requires both medical and social
approaches. Substance addicts may need hospital treat-
ment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual or
group psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after sub-
stance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications, such
as methadoneand naltrexone, are also commonly used.
The most frequently recommended social form of
outpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Such
programs are also frequently combined with psychother-
apy. According to a recent study reported by the Ameri-
can Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless
of his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,
can benefit from participation in 12-step programs such
as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anony-
mous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help
groups exceeds the number of visits to all mental health
professionals combined. There are twelve-step groups
for all major substance and process addictions.
The Twelve Steps are:
• Admit powerlessness over the addiction.
• Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restore
sanity.
• Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to
the care of God, as you understand him.
• Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self.
• Admit to God, yourself, and another human being the
exact nature of your wrongs.
• Become willing to have God remove all these defects
from your character.
• Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.
• Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs and
become willing to make amends to them all.
• Make direct amends to such people, whenever possible
except when to do so would injure them or others.
• Continue to take personal inventory and promptly
admit any future wrongdoings.
• Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’s
understanding through meditationand prayer.
• Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others and
practice these principles in all your affairs.
Alternative treatment
Acupunctureand homeopathyhave been used to
treat withdrawal symptoms. Meditation,yoga, and reiki
healing have been recommended for process addictions,
however, the success of these programs has not been well
documented through controlled studies.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery from any addiction
depends on the substance or process, the individual’s cir-
cumstances, and underlying personality structure. Poly-
drug users have the worst prognosis for recovery.
Prevention
The most effective form of prevention appears to be
a stable family that models responsible attitudes toward
mood-altering substances and behaviors. Prevention edu-
cation programs are also widely used to inform the pub-
lic of the harmfulness of substance abuse.

Addison’s disease
Definition
Addison’s disease is a disorder involving disrupted
functioning of the part of the adrenal gland called the
cortex. This results in decreased production of two
important chemicals (hormones) normally released by
the adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.
Description
The adrenals are two glands, each perched on the
upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the gland
is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the
medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is
responsible for producing different types of hormones.
Cortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the
adrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning
of nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout the
body, and is considered to be one of the few hormones
absolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:
• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-
ents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins
• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and
the heart
KEY TERMS
Gland—A collection of cells whose function is to
release certain chemicals, or hormones, which are
important to the functioning of other, sometimes
distantly located, organs or body systems.
Hormone—A chemical produced in one part of
the body, which travels to another part of the body
in order to exert its effect.
• the functioning of muscles
• normal kidney function
• production of blood cells
• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-
tal system
• proper functioning of the brain and nerves
• the normal responses of the immune system
Aldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,
plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-
portions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-
ance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughout
the body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a
drop in blood pressure.
Addison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-
cal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferes
directly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce
its hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosterone
drop, and numerous functions throughout the body are
disrupted.
Addison’s disease occurs in about four in every
100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of Addison’s disease is the
destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal
cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is
believed to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an
autoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,
responsible for identifying foreign invaders such as
viruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins
to identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, and
destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of
the adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The
remaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by
fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomy-
cosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal
gland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53  called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis,in
which a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited in
abnormal places throughout the body, interfering with
the function of whatever structure it is present within; or
invasion of the adrenal glands by cancer.
In about 75% of all patients, Addison’s disease
tends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease.
Significant symptoms are not noted until about 90% of
the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The most com-
mon symptoms include fatigueand loss of energy,
decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea,
abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness,dizzi-
nesswhen standing,dehydration, unusual areas of
darkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the
disease progresses, the patient may appear to have very
tanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining of
the mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentation
of the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration
becomes more severe, the blood pressure will continue
to drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak and
light-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-
toms, including depression and irritability. Women lose
pubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-
strual periods.
When a patient becomes ill with an infection, or
stressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and
rapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms
of this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heart
rhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-
trollable nausea and vomiting, a drastic drop in blood
pressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About
25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified due
to the development of Addisonian crisis.
Diagnosis
Many patients do not recognize the slow progres-
sion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified
when a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-
tation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of blood
tests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It is
not sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,
as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,
patients are given a testing dose of another hormone
called corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in the
body by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-
moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulating
the production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-
ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase
cortisol levels.
To distinguish between primary adrenocortical
insufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary
adrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the
pituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in
the blood are examined. Normal or high levels of
ACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,
but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to the
presence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis of
Addison’s disease.
Treatment
Treatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing
the missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-
onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potent
form of steroid preparation through a needle placed in a
vein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss will
also be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-
tions through the IV. Dangerously low blood pressure
may require special medications to safely elevate it until
the steroids take effect.
Patients with Addison’s disease will need to take a
steroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement
for aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest of
their lives. When a patient has an illness which causes
nausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold down
their medications), he or she will need to enter a medical
facility where IV medications can be administered.
When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, the
normal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.
Prognosis
Prognosis for patients appropriately treated with
hydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. These
patients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Without
treatment, or with substandard treatment, patients are
always at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.

Addison’s disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 54  Adenoid hyperplasia
Definition
Adenoid hyperplasia is the overenlargement of the
lymph glands located above the back of the mouth.
Description
Located at the back of the mouth above and below
the soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands. The tonsils
below are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-
noids lie just above them and are hidden from view by the
palate. Together these four arsenals of immune defense
guard the major entrance to the body from foreign
invaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to the
rest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its
greatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. In
this way children are best able to develop the immunities
they need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.
Beyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue
grows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-
tion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fight
off the invaders. Often it does not completely return to its
former size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind a
larger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make matters
worse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophied
glands can produce safe havens for germs where the
body cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi-
oticsand the reduction in infectious childhood diseases
over the past few generations, tonsils and adenoids
caused greater health problems.
Causes and symptoms
Most tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply
caused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-
sue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throat
infections by cold viruses,strep throat, mononucleosis,
and in times gone by,diphtheria. The acute infections
are usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting
little recognition because they cannot be seen without
special instruments. Symptoms include painful, bright
red, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes
(glands) beneath the jaw,fever, and general discomfort.
After the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-
erated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely large
tonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although that
is quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathing
and require a child to breathe through the mouth. Because
they encircle the only connection between the middle ear
and the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can also
obstruct it and cause middle ear infections.
KEY TERMS
Eustacian tube—A tube connecting the middle ear
with the back of the nose, allowing air pressure to
equalize within the ear whenever it opens, such as
with yawning.
Hyperplastic—Overgrown.
Hypertrophy—Overgrowth.
Strep throat—An infection of the throat caused by
bacteria of the Streptococcusfamily, which causes
tonsillitis.
Ulcerated—Damaged so that the surface tissue is
lost and/or necrotic (dead).
Diagnosis
A simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows
an adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils may
have deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue
(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-
ror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle ear
infections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-
tureor mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-
ty of the germ.
Treatment
It used to be standard practice to remove tonsils
and/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or ear
infection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-
noidectomy(T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized
that this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-
ty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-
duce only half the immunity to oral poliovaccine. In addi-
tion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibiotics
and of recurring ear infections with surgical drainage
through the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reduced
the incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.
Alternative treatment
There are many botanical/herbal remedies that can
be used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsils
and adenoids in their immune function at the opening of
the oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping the
Eustachian tubes open is an important contribution to
optimal function in the tonsils and adenoids. Food aller-
giesare often the culprits for recurring ear infections, as
well as tonsilitis and adenoiditis. Identification and
removal of the allergic food(s) can greatly assist in alle-

Adenoid hyperplasia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 55  viating the cause of the problem. Acute tonsillitis also
benefits from warm saline gargles.
Prognosis
Hypertrophied adenoids are a normal part of grow-
ing up and should be respected for their important role in
the development of immunity. Only when their size caus-
es problems by obstructing breathing or middle ear
drainage do they demand intervention.
Prevention
Prevention can be directed toward prompt evaluation
and appropriate treatment of sore throats to prevent over-
growth of adenoid tissue. Avoiding other children with
acute respiratory illness will also reduce the spread of
these common illnesses.

Adenovirus infections
Definition
Adenoviruses are DNA viruses (small infectious
agents) that cause upper respiratory tract infections,con-
junctivitis, and other infections in humans.
Description
Adenoviruses were discovered in 1953. About 47 dif-
ferent types have been identified since then, and about
half of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infants
and children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-
es. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,
but seem to be most common from fall to spring.
Adenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-
piratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-
nesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to cause
infection among military recruits and other young people
who live in institutional environments. Outbreaks among
children are frequently reported at boarding schools and
summer camps.
Acquired immunity
Most children have been infected by at least one
adenovirus by the time they reach school age. Most
adults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus
types due to infections they had as children.
In one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic
infection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-
noviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-
lion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-
tious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. In
chronic or latent infection, a much smaller number of
viruses are released and healthy cells can multiply more
rapidly than they are destroyed. People who have this
kind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probably
why many adults have immunity to adenoviruses without
realizing they have been infected.
Childhood infections
In children, adenoviruses most often cause acute
upper respiratory infections with feverand runny nose.
Adenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible for
most of these infections. Occasionally more serious
lower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, may
occur.
Adenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival
fever in children. This disease is most often caused by
types 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly and
usually disappear in less than a week, include:
• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)
•fever
•sore throat(pharyngitis)
• runny nose
• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical
adenitis)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 256
Adenovirus infections
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56  Adenoviruses also cause acute diarrheain young
children, characterized by fever and watery stools. This
condition is caused by adenovirus types 40 and 41 and
can last as long as two weeks.
As much as 51% of all hemorrhagic cystitis(inflam-
mation of the bladder and of the tubes that carry urine to
the bladder from the kidneys) in American and Japanese
children can be attributed to adenovirus infection. A
child who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine for
about three days, and invisible traces of blood can be
found in the urine a few days longer. The child will feel
the urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to do
so—for about the same length of time.
Adult infections
In adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus
infection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused by
types 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-
toms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough
are almost always present; weakness, chills,headache,
and swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.
The symptoms typically last three to five days.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-
novirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyard
workers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips of
rust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye-
lid and covering the front of the eyeball can also be
caused by using contaminated contact lens solutions or
by drying the hands or face with a towel used by some-
one who has this infection.
The inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con-
junctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and last
between one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of patients with
epidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience respiratory
symptoms. One or both eyes may be affected. As symp-
toms of conjunctivitis subside, eye painand watering
and blurred vision develop. These symptoms of keratitis
may last for several months, and about 10% of these
infections spread to at least one other member of the
patient’s household.
Other illnesses associated with adenovirus include:
• encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and other
infections of the central nervous system (CNS)
• gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intes-
tines)
• acute mesenteric lymphadenitis(inflammation of
lymph glands in the abdomen)
• chronic interstitial fibrosis (abnormal growth of con-
nective tissue between cells)
• intussusception (a type of intestinal obstruction)
KEY TERMS
Conjunctivitis—Inflammation of the conjunctiva,
the mucous membrane lining the inner surfaces of
the eyelid and the front of the eyeball.
Virus—A small infectious agent consisting of a
core of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surround-
ed by a shell of protein.
• pneumonia that doesn’t respond to antibiotic therapy
•whooping coughsyndrome when Bordetella pertussis
(the bacterium that causes classic whooping cough) is
not found
Causes and symptoms
Specific adenovirus infections can be traced to par-
ticular sources and produce distinctive symptoms. In
general, however, adenovirus infection is caused by:
• inhaling airborne viruses
• getting the virus in the eyes by swimming in contami-
nated water, using contaminated eye solutions or instru-
ments, wiping the eyes with contaminated towels, or
rubbing the eyes with contaminated fingers.
• not washing the hands after using the bathroom, and
then touching the mouth or eyes
Symptoms common to most types of adenovirus
infections include:
• cough
•fever
• runny nose
• sore throat
• watery eyes
Diagnosis
Although symptoms may suggest the presence of
adenovirus, distinguishing these infections from other
viruses can be difficult. A definitive diagnosis is based on
culture or detection of the virus in eye secretions, spu-
tum, urine, or stool.
The extent of infection can be estimated from the
results of blood tests that measure increases in the quan-
tity of antibodies the immune system produces to fight it.
Antibody levels begin to rise about a week after infection
occurs and remain elevated for about a year.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	57
Adenovirus infections
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 57  Treatment
Treatment of adenovirus infections is usually sup-
portive and aimed at relieving symptoms of the illness.
Bed rest may be recommended along with medications to
reduce fever and/or pain. (Aspirinshould not be given to
children because of concerns about Reye’s syndrome.)
Eye infections may benefit from topical corticosteroids
to relieve symptoms and shorten the course of the dis-
ease. Hospitalization is usually required for severe pneu-
monia in infants and for EKC (to prevent blindness). No
effective antiviral drugshave been developed.
Prognosis
Adenovirus infections are rarely fatal. Most patients
recover fully.
Prevention
Practicing good personal hygiene and avoiding peo-
ple with infectious illnesses can reduce the risk of devel-
oping adenovirus infection. Proper handwashing can pre-
vent the spread of the virus by oral-fecal transmission.
Sterilization of instruments and solutions used in the eye
can prevent the spread of EKC, as can adequate chlorina-
tion of swimming pools.
A vaccine containing live adenovirus types 4 and 7
is used to control disease in military recruits, but it is not
recommended or available for civilian use. Vaccines pre-
pared from purified subunits of adenovirus are under
investigation.

Adjustment disorders
Definition
An adjustment disorder is a debilitating reaction,
usually lasting less than six months, to a stressful event
or situation. It is not the same thing as post-traumatic
stress disorder(PTSD), which usually occurs in reac-
tion to a life-threatening event and can be longer lasting.
Description
An adjustment disorder usually begins within three
months of a stressful event, and ends within six months
after the stressor stops. There are many different sub-
types of adjustment disorders, including adjustment dis-
order with:
• depression
•anxiety
• mixed anxiety and depression
• conduct disturbances
• mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct
• unspecified
Adjustment disorders are very common and can
affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or lifestyle.
By definition, an adjustment disorder is short-lived,
unless a person is faced with a chronic recurring crisis
(such as a child who is repeatedly abused). In such cases,
the adjustment disorder may last more than six months.
Causes and symptoms
An adjustment disorder occurs when a person can’t
cope with a stressful event and develops emotional or
behavioral symptoms. The stressful event can be anything:
it might be just one isolated incident, or a string of prob-
lems that wears the person down. The stressmight be any-
thing from a car accident or illness, to a divorce, or even a
certain time of year (such as Christmas or summer).
People with adjustment disorder may have a wide
variety of symptoms. How those symptoms combine
depend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorder
and on the individual’s personality and psychological
defenses. Symptoms normally include some (but not all)
of the following:
• hopelessness
• sadness
• crying
• anxiety
• worry
• headaches or stomachaches
• withdrawal
• inhibition
• truancy
• vandalism
• reckless driving
• fighting
• other destructive acts
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 258
Adjustment disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 58  Diagnosis
It is extremely important that a thorough evaluation
rule out other more serious mental disorders, since the
treatment for adjustment disorder may be very different
than for other mental problems.
In order to be diagnosed as a true adjustment disor-
der, the level of distress must be more severe than what
would normally be expected in response to the stressor,
or the symptoms must significantly interfere with a per-
son’s social, job, or school functioning. Normal expres-
sion of grief, in bereavement for instance, is not consid-
ered an adjustment disorder.
Treatment
Psychotherapy (counseling) is the treatment of
choice for adjustment disorders, since the symptoms are
an understandable reaction to a specific stress. The type
of therapy depends on the mental health expert, but it
usually is short-term treatment that focuses on resolving
the immediate problem.
Therapy usually will help clients:
• develop coping skills
• understand how the stressor has affected their lives
• develop alternate social or recreational activities
Family or couples therapy may be helpful in some
cases. Medications are not usually used to treat adjust-
ment disorders, although sometimes a few days or weeks
of an anti-anxiety drug can control anxiety or sleeping
problems.
Self-help groups aimed at a specific problem (such
as recovering from divorce or job loss) can be extremely
helpful to people suffering from an adjustment disorder.
Social support, which is usually an important part of self-
help groups, can lead to a quicker recovery.
Prognosis
Most people recover completely from adjustment
disorders, especially if they had no previous history of
mental problems, and have a stable home life with strong
social support. People with progressive or cyclic disor-
ders (such as multiple sclerosis) may experience an
adjustment disorder with each exacerbation period.

Adrenal gland cancer
Definition
Adrenal gland cancers are rare cancers occuring in
the endocrine tissue of the adrenals. They are character-
ized by overproduction of adrenal gland hormones.
Description
Cancers of the adrenal gland are very rare. The
adrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland
with two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The
main hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the
main hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.
When tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secrete
excess amounts of these hormones. A cancerthat arises
in the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino-
ma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain,
excess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. A
cancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy-
tomaand can cause high blood pressure,headache,pal-
pitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these can-
cers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults.
Causes and symptoms
It is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,
but some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	59
Adrenal gland cancer
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 59  Symptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific
hormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical car-
cinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol, pro-
ducing Cushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome produces
progressive weight gain, rounding of the face, and
increased blood pressure. Women can experience men-
strual cycle alterations and men can experience feminiza-
tion. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma include
hypertension, acidosis, unexplained feverand weight
loss. Because of the hormones produced by this type of
tumor,anxietyis often a feature also.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with
blood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor-
mones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone. It
also includes magnetic resonance imaging, and com-
puted tomography scansto determine the extent of the
disease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect the
high levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at removing the tumor by
surgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy.
Surgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapyand/or
radiation therapy. Because the surgery removes the
source of many important hormones, hormones must be
supplemented following surgery. If adrenocortical cancer
recurs or has spread to other parts of the body (metasta-
sized), additional surgery may be done followed by
chemotherapy using the drug mitotane.
KEY TERMS
Cortisol—A hormone produced by the adrenal
cortex. It is partially responsible for regulating
blood sugar levels.
Diabetes—A disease characterized by low blood
sugar.
Epinephrine—A hormone produced by the adren-
al medulla. It is important in the response to stress
and partially regulates heart rate and metabolism.
It is also called adrenaline.
Laparoscopy—The insertion of a tube through the
abdominal wall. It can be used to visualize the
inside of the abdomen and for surgical procedures.
Alternative treatment
As with any form of cancer, all conventional treat-
ment options should be considered and applied as appro-
priate. Nutritional support, as well as supporting the func-
tioning of the entire person diagnosed with adrenal gland
cancer through homeopathic medicine,acupuncture, vit-
amin and mineral supplementation, and herbal medicine,
can benefit recovery and enhance quality of life.
Prognosis
The prognosis for adrenal gland cancer is variable.
For localized pheochromocytomas the 5-year survival rate
is 95%. This rate decreases with aggressive tumors that
have metastasized. The prognosis for adrenal cortical can-
cer is not as good with a 5-year survival rate of 10-35%.
Prevention
Since so little is known about the cause of adrenal
gland cancer, it is not known if it can be prevented.

Adrenal gland scan
Definition
The adrenal gland scan is a nuclear medicine evalua-
tion of the medulla (inner tissue) of the adrenal gland.
Purpose
The adrenal glands are a pair of small organs located
just above the kidney, which contain two types of tissue.
The adrenal cortex produces hormones that affect water
balance and metabolism in the body. The adrenal medul-
la produces adrenaline and noradrenaline (also called
epinepherine and norepinepherine).
An adrenal gland scan is done when too much
adrenaline and noradrenaline is produced in the body and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 260
Adrenal gland scan
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 60  a tumor in the adrenal gland is suspected. One such situa-
tion in which a tumor might be suspected is when high
blood pressure (hypertension) does not respond to med-
ication. Tumors that secrete adrenaline and noradrenaline
can also be found outside the adrenal gland. An adrenal
gland scan usually covers the abdomen, chest, and head.
Precautions
Adrenal gland scans are not recommended for preg-
nant women because of the potential harm to the devel-
oping fetus. A pregnant woman should discuss with her
doctor the risks of the procedure against the benefits of
the information it can provide in evaluating her individ-
ual medical situation.
People who have recently undergone tests that use
barium must wait until the barium has been eliminated
from their system in order to obtain accurate results from
the adrenal gland scan.
Description
The adrenal gland scan takes several days. On the
first day, a radiopharmaceutical is injected intravenously
into the patient. On the second, third, and fourth day the
patient is positioned under the camera for imaging. The
scanning time each day takes approximately 30 minutes.
It is essential that the patient remain still during imaging.
Occasionally, the scanning process may involve
fewer than three days, or it may continue several days
longer. The area scanned extends from the pelvis and
lower abdomen to the lower chest. Sometimes the upper
legs, thighs, and head are also included.
Preparation
For two days before and ten days after the injection
of the radiopharmaceutical, patients are given either
Lugol’s solution or potassium iodine. This prevents the
thyroid from taking up radioactive iodine and interfering
with the scan.
Aftercare
The patient should not feel any adverse effects of the
test and can resume normal activity immediately. Follow-
up tests that might be ordered include a nuclear scan of
the bones or kidney, a computed tomography scan (CT)
of the adrenals, or an ultrasound of the pelvic area.
Risks
The main risk associated with this test is to the fetus
of a pregnant woman.
KEY TERMS
Adrenal cortex—The outer tissue of the adrenal
gland. It produces a group of chemically related
hormones called corticosteroids that control min-
eral and water balance in the body and include
aldosterone and cortisol.
Adrenal medulla—The inner tissue of the adrenal
gland. It produces the hormones adrenaline and
noradrenaline.
Lugol’s solution—A strong iodine solution.
Normal results
Normal results will show no unusual areas of hor-
mone secretion and no tumors.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results will show evidence of a tumor
where there is excessive secretion of adrenaline or nora-
drenaline. Over 90% of these tumors are in the abdomen.

Adrenal virilism
Definition
Adrenal virilism is the development or premature
development of male secondary sexual characteristics
caused by male sex hormones (androgens) excessively
produced by the adrenal gland. This disorder can occur
before birth and can lead to sexual abnormalities in new-
borns. It can also occur in girls and women later in life.
Description
In the normal human body, there are two adrenal
glands. They are small structures that lie on top of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	61
Adrenal virilism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 61  kidneys. The adrenal glands produce many hormones
that regulate body functions. These hormones include
androgens, or male hormones. Androgens are produced
in normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or both of
the adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro-
ducing more than the usual amount of androgens. The
excess androgens create masculine characteristics.
Causes and symptoms
In infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually
the result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present at
birth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
The cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to
severe enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril-
ism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor can
be benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car-
cinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type of
tumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).
Newborn girls with adrenal virilism have external
sex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and female
organs (called female pseudohermaphrodism). Newborn
boys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs,
and these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace.
Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begin
growing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlier
than normal. Later in childhood, they are typically short-
er than normal but have well-developed trunks.
Women with adrenal virilization may develop facial
hair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent or
absent. They may also develop a deeper voice, a more
prominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.
Diagnosis
Endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the
diagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have the
most expertise to deal with adrenal virilization. Some
KEY TERMS
Glucocorticoid—A hormone produced by the
adrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increase
in blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules by
the liver.
Hydrocortisone—A hormone in the group of glu-
cocorticoid hormones.
Prednisone—A drug that functions as a glucocorti-
coid hormone.
doctors who treat disorders of the internal organs
(internists) and doctors who specialize in treating the
reproductive system of women (gynecologists) may also
be able to help patients with this disorder.
Diagnosis involves performing many laboratory
tests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea-
sure the concentration of different hormones. Different
abnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a different
pattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can also
help determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If a
tumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-
ize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend on
obtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), and
examining it under a microscope in order to verify its
characteristics.
Treatment
Adrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is
treated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usually
prednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-
tisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-
ed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls with
pseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make their
external sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor is
causing the disorder, the treatment will depend on the
type and location of the tumor. Information about the
tumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used to
decide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient.
If the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require special
treatment depending on how far the cancerhas
advanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery,
medications used to kill cancer cells (chemotherapy),
and x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancer
cells (radiation therapy). Sometimes the doctor must
remove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. If
the tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumor
may be the best option.
Prognosis
Ongoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls
adrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but there
is no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder,
patients have a better prognosis if they have an early stage
of cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread.

Adrenalectomy
Definition
Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or
both of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are paired
endocrine glands, one located above each kidney, that
produce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,
androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-
lectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)
surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use
laparoscopy. With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be
accomplished through four very small incisions.
Purpose
Adrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with
tumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors may
be malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessive
amounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-
dure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and may
also remove cancerous tumors that can invade other parts
of the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-
mended when hormones produced by the adrenal glands
aggravate another condition such as breast cancer.
Precautions
The adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-
sels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding
during surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close to
one of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),
and to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs to
remove the gland(s) without damaging any of these
important and delicate organs.
Description
Open adrenalectomy
The surgeon may operate from any of four direc-
tions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’s
body type.
In the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the
abdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,
just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operate
on only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will run	under just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-	times a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen	provides a better approach, especially if both adrenal	glands are involved.
In the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the
back, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to be
removed, an incision is made on each side of the body.
This approach is the most direct route to the adrenal
glands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of the
surrounding structures as the anterior approach.
In the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the
patient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obese
patients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeon
must remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn the
patient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.
The last approach involves an incision into the chest
cavity, either with or without part of the incision into the
abdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipates
a very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine or
remove nearby structures as well.
Laparoscopic adrenalectomy
This technique does not require the surgeon to open
the body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2
in diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, just
under the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-
geon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on a
television monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.
The other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturized
versions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to be
operated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-
side the body.
Preparation
Most aspects of preparation are the same as in other
major operations. In addition, hormone imbalances are
often a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicians
will try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-
tion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors
may cause other problems such as hypertensionor inad-
equate potassium in the blood, and these problems also
should be resolved if possible before surgery is per-
formed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicines
for days or weeks before surgery.
Most adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a
CT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-
ent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeons
may order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing of
the location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help
locate exactly where the tumor is.

an enema to clear the bowels. In patients with lung prob-
lems or clotting problems, physicians may advise special
preparations.
Aftercare
Patients stay in the hospital for various lengths of
time after adrenalectomy. The longest hospital stays are
required for open surgery using an anterior approach;
hospital stays of about three days are indicated for open
surgery using the posterior approach or for laparoscopic
adrenalectomy.
The special concern after adrenalectomy is the
patient’s hormone balance. There may be several sets of
lab tests to define hormone problems and monitor the
results of drug treatment. In addition, blood pressure
problems and infections are more common after removal
of certain types of adrenal tumors.
As with most open surgery, surgeons are also con-
cerned about blood clots forming in the legs and travel-
ing to the lungs (venous thromboembolism), bowel prob-
lems, and postoperative pain. With laparoscopic adrena-
lectomy, these problems are somewhat less difficult, but
they are still present.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone
test
Definition
Adrenocorticotropic hormone test (also known as an
ACTH test or a corticotropin test) measures pituitary
gland function.
Purpose
The pituitary gland produces the hormone ACTH,
which stimulates the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the
adrenal cortex). ACTH causes the release of the hormones
hydrocortisone (cortisol), aldosterone, and androgen. The
most important of these hormones released is cortisol.
The ACTH test is used to determine if too much cortisol
is being produced (Cushing’s syndrome) or if not
enough cortisol is being produced (Addison’s disease).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 264
Adrenocorticotropic hormone test
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 64  Precautions
ACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the levels
of this hormone vary according to the time of day. The
highest levels occur in the morning hours. Testing for
normal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s disease, may
require multiple samples. For sequential follow-up, a
blood sample analyzed for ACTH should always be
drawn at the same time each day.
ACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing
method (immunoassay) in many large laboratories. How-
ever, smaller laboratories are usually not equipped to per-
form this test and they may need to send the blood sam-
ple to a larger laboratory. Because of this delay, results
may take several days to obtain.
Description
ACTH production is partly controlled by an area in
the center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partly
controlled by the level of cortisol in the blood. When
ACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increases
to suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. If
ACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus produces
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate the
pituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels rise in
response to stress, emotions, injury, infection,burns,
surgery, and decreased blood pressure.
Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally high
level of circulating hydrocortisone. The high level may be
the result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement of
both adrenal glands due to a pituitary tumor. The high
level of hydrocortisone may be the result of taking corti-
costeroid drugs for a long time. Corticosteroid drugs are
widely used for inflammation in disorders like rheuma-
toid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma.
Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is a rare disorder in which
symptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocorti-
sone and aldosterone. The most common cause of this
disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune sys-
tem normally fights foreign invaders in the body like
bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune sys-
tems attacks the body. In this case, the immune system
produces antibodies that attack the adrenal glands.
Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, with
symptoms developing gradually over months or years.
However, acute episodes, called Addisonian crises, are
brought on by infection, injury, or other stresses. Diag-
nosis is generally made if the patient fails to respond to

an injection of ACTH, which normally stimulates the
secretion of hydrocortisone.
Preparation
A person’s ACTH level is determined from a blood
sample. The patient must fast from midnight until the test
the next morning. This means that the patient cannot eat
or drink anything after midnight except water. The patient
must also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recently
administered radioisotopes prior to the blood test.
Risks
The risks associated with this test are minimal. They
may include slight bleeding from the location where the
blood was drawn. The patient may feel faint or lighthead-
ed after the blood is drawn. Sometimes the patient may
have an accumulation of blood under the puncture site
(hematoma) after the test.
Normal results
Each laboratory will have its own set of normal val-
ues for this test. The normal values can range from:
Morning (4-8 
A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI units)
Evening (8-10 
P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less than 50
ng/L (SI units)
Abnormal results
In Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH may
be caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumors
may be either in the pituitary or in another area (like
tumors from lung canceror ovarian cancer). Low
ACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement due
to high levels of cortisol and feedback to the pituitary.
In Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may be
caused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases decrease
adrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts to increase
functioning. Low levels of ACTH may occur because of
decreased pituitary function.

Adrenoleukodystrophy
Definition
Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare genetic disease
characterized by a loss of myelin surrounding nerve cells
in the brain and progressive adrenal gland dysfunction.
Description
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a member of a
group of diseases, leukodystrophies, that cause damage
to the myelin sheath of nerve cells. Approximately one in
100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basic
forms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. The
childhood form of the disease is the classical form and is
the most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-
ally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys
because the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the X
chromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages four
and ten and can include many different symptoms, not all
of which appear together. The most common symptoms
are behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-
toms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorly
articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-
lems with gait and coordination,fatigue, increased skin
pigmentation, and progressive dementia.
The adult-onset form of the disease, also called
adrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, is
usually associated with a normal life span, and usually
appears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may include
progressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysisof the lower
limbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-
tion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of the
disease occasionally experience the same symptoms, as
well as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessive
muscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary
problems. The neonatal form affects both male and
female infants and may produce mental retardation,
facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor
muscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.	Neonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.
Causes and symptoms
The genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the
ability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These build
up in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.
The build-up of very long chain fatty acids interferes
with the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-
terol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in
the white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cells
are unable to function properly.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a
biochemical test, and a family history. The biochemical
test detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids
in samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi, plasma,
red blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-
cate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carried
on the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.
Treatment
Treatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating
the symptoms and supporting the patient with physical
therapy, psychological counseling, and special education
in some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and there
are no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve and
brain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing the
intake of foods high in fat, which are a source of very
long chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oil
has been shown to reduce the level of long chain fatty
acids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss

tionhas not been very effective.
Prognosis
Prognosis for childhood and neonatal ALD patients
is poor because of the progressive myelin degeneration.
Death usually occurs between one and ten years after
onset of symptoms.
Prevention
Since ALD is a genetic disease, prevention is largely
limited to genetic counselingand fetal monitoring
through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.

Adult respiratory distress
syndrome
Definition
Adult respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), also
called acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type of
lung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis-
ease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in the
lungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-
drome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one
of the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-
ure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose
lungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a
true medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown
of the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid
from leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung
into the breathing sacs (the alveoli).
Description
Another name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal
name is misleading, because children, as well as adults,
may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,
or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs
at the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).
This is the all-important site where oxygen passes from	air that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts	of the body. Any form of lung injury that damages this	point of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,	will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,	eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result	is the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is	one of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the	other being heart failure.
Along with fluid there is a marked increase in
inflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over
from damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-
al derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these
materials join together with large molecules in the blood
(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-
branes are very prominent in premature infants who
develop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called
hyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or
lasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather become
scarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-
mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of the
lung to become narrower, and in time they, too, may
become scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungs
as a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes much
harder for the patient to breathe.
Causes and symptoms
A very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,
including some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:
• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when
regurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearly
drowning.
• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,
such as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-
gen, which itself can injure the lungs.
• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a wide-
spread infection that gets into the blood.
• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the
body.
• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in
itself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.
• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-
cular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vessels
throughout the body, including the lungs.
• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-
eling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-
sels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.
• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,
aspirin.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	67
Adult respiratory distress syndrome
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67  • Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), when
blood proteins, called enzymes, pass to the lungs and
injure lung cells.
• Severe burn injury.
• Injury of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, from any
cause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that are not
clear. Convulsions also may cause some cases.
Usually ARDS develops within one to two days of the
original illness or injury. The person begins to take rapid
but shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’s
chest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez-
ingsounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the
skin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues to
fill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great trouble
breathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.
Diagnosis
A simple test using a device applied to the ear will
show whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, and
this can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from an
artery. The chest x raymay be normal in the early stages,
but, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does not
belong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heart
of normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDS
and not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-
guish between these two possibilities is to place a catheter

ing tubes of the lung where oxygen normally is

into a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.
In this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillaries
can be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-
ies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.
Treatment
The three main goals in treating patients with ARDS
are:
• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.
Examples are: to treat septic infection with the proper
antibiotics, and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if
ARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.
• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to
leak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-
tain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones have
been tried because they can combat inflammation, but
the actual results have been disappointing.
• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the
lung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered by
a face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on a
ventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through a
tube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in the
windpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatment
must be closely supervised, and the pressure adjusted
so that too much oxygen is not delivered.
Patients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-
sive care unit, where experienced staff and all needed
equipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,
by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration. Also, the
patient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again by
vein, if oral intake is not sufficient.
Prognosis
If the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to
heal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,
such as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterial
pneumoniawill develop at some point. Without prompt
treatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can be
expected to die. With modern treatment, however, about
half of all patients will survive. Those who do live usually
recover completely, with little or no long-term breathing
difficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on a
ventilator, but it may improve in the months after the
patient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular
patient will recover depends to a great extent on whether
the primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in the
first place can be effectively treated.
Prevention
The only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-
eases and harmful conditions that damage the lung. For

the lungs can be avoided by making sure a patient does not
eat shortly before receiving general anesthesia. If a patient
needs oxygen therapy, as low a level as possible should be
given. Any form of lung infection, or infection anywhere
in the body that gets into the blood, must be treated
promptly to avoid the lung injury that causes ARDS.

Aging
Definition
Starting at what is commonly called middle age, oper-
ations of the human body begin to be more vulnerable to
daily wear and tear; there is a general decline in physical,
and possibly mental, functioning. In the Western countries,
the length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit of
the life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. During
the latter half of life, an individual is more prone to have	problems with the various functions of the body and to	develop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-	diovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive	and urinary systems are particularly affected. The most	common diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,	cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.
Description
Human beings reach a peak of growth and develop-
ment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normal
transition time after that flurry of activity. Although there
are quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-
ability is not necessarily a part of aging. Health and
lifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of the
individual, and determines the response to these changes.
Body functions that are most often affected by age include:
• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the
highest pitched tones.
• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase by
as much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of body
fat directly under the skin thins out and accumulates
around the stomach. The ability to excrete fats is
impaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,
including cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.
• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-
fore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.
Also, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.
• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,
thus affecting the elimination of wastes.
• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in
stomach acid production.
• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an
accompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.
• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.
• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.
• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,
leading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughout
the body.
• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that
nerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-
es are not as sharp, and memory and learning are
diminished.
• A decrease in bone strength and density.
• Hormone levels, which gradually decline. The thyroid
and sexual hormones are particularly affected.
• Declining visual abilities. Age-related changes may
lead to diseases such as macular degeneration.

light.
• A reduction in protein formation leading to shrinkage
in muscle mass and decreased bone formation, possibly
leading to osteoporosis.
Causes and symptoms
There are several theories as to why the aging body
loses functioning. It may be that several factors work
together or that one particular factor is at work more than
others in a given individual.
• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The
aging of the cells of each individual is programmed into
the genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-
venations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at a
rate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-
tion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain the
functions necessary for life.
• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed of
destruction at the level of the chromosomes.
• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes in
the make-up of the connective tissue alter the stability
of body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-
tioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.
• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of
aging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical
reactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-
ence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of the
body to break down. As time goes on, more cells die or
lose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases to
function as a whole.
• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune
system as it begins to wear out, and the body is more
prone to infections and tissue damage, which may finally
cause death. Also, as the system breaks down, the body
is more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which the
body’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material and
are destroyed or damaged by the immune system.
Diagnosis
Many problems can arise due to age-related changes
in the body. Although there is no one test to be given, a
thorough physical exam and a basic blood screening and
blood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-
ther attention. When older people become ill, the first
signs of disease are often nonspecific. Further exams
should be conducted if any of the following occur:
• diminished or lack of desire for food
• increasing confusion
• failure to thrive
• urinary incontinence
• dizziness
• weight loss
• falling
Treatment
For the most part, doctors prescribe medications to
control the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-
ed States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over take
medications for various complaints. More women than
men use these medications. The most common drugs
used by the elderly are painkillers,diureticsor water
pills, sedatives, cardiac drugs,antibiotics, and mental
health drugs.
Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly
prescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms of
aging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.
ERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk of
heart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improve
skin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also help
maintain mental functions.
Expected results
Aging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-
ment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free life
well through their later years. A well established support
system of family, friends, and health care providers,
together with focus on good nutritionand lifestyle
habits and good stressmanagement, can prevent disease
and lessen the impact of chronic conditions.
Alternative treatment
Nutritional supplements
Consumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-
ommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connected
with aging include B vitamins, vitamins A and C,folic
acid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and
trace minerals. Since stomach acids may be decreased, it
is suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-
mula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-
est to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymes
for further help with digestion.
Antioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the
free radical actions thought to contribute to problems of
aging. They are also helpful in preventing and treating
cancer and in treating cataractsand glaucoma. Supple-
ments that serve as antioxidants include:

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 70  • Vitamin E, 400–1,000 IUs daily. Protects cell mem-
branes against damage. It shows promise in prevention
against heart disease, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases.
• Selenium, 50 mg taken twice daily. Research suggests
that selenium may play a role in reducing the risk of
cancer.
• Beta-carotene, 25,000–40,000 IUs daily. May help in
treating cancer, colds and flu, arthritis, and immune
support.
• Vitamin C, 1,000–2,000 mg per day. It may cause diar-
rheain large doses. If this occurs, however, all that is
needed is a decrease in the dosage.
Other supplements that are helpful in treating age-
related problems including:
•B
12/B-complex vitamins, studies show that B
12may help
reduce mental symptoms, such as confusion, memory
loss, and depression.
• Coenzyme Q10 may be helpful in treating heart dis-
ease, as up to three-quarters cardiac patients have been
found to be lacking in this heart enzyme.
Hormones
The following hormone supplements may be taken
to prevent or to treat various age-related problems. How-
ever, caution should be taken before beginning treatment,
and the patient should consult his or her health care pro-
fessional.
DHEA improves brain functioning and serves as a
building block for many other important hormones in the
body. It may be helpful in restoring declining hormone
levels and in building up muscle mass, strengthening the
bones, and maintaining a healthy heart.
Melatonin may be helpful for insomnia. It has also
been used to help fight viruses and bacterial infections,
reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sexual function-
ing, and to protect against cancer.
Human growth hormone (hGH) has been shown to
regulate blood sugar levels and to stimulate bone, carti-
lage, and muscle growth while reducing fat.
Herbs
Garlic (Allium sativa) is helpful in preventing heart
disease, as well as improving the tone and texture of
skin. Garlic stimulates liver and digestive system func-
tions, and also helps in dealing with heart disease and
high blood pressure.
Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) sup-
ports the adrenal glands and immune functions. It is

In Ayurvedic medicine, aging is described as a
process of increased vata, in which there is a tendency to
become thinner, drier, more nervous, more restless, and
more fearful, while having a loss of appetite as well as
sleep. Bananas, almonds, avocados, and coconuts are
some of the foods used in correcting such conditions.
One of the main herbs used for such conditions is gotu
kola (Centella asiatica), which is used to revitalize the
nervous system and brain cells and to fortify the immune
system. Gotu kola is also used to treat memory loss,anx-
iety, and insomnia.
In Chinese medicine, most symptoms of aging are
regarded as symptoms of a yin deficiency. Moistening
foods such as millet, barley soup, tofu, mung beans,
wheat germ, spirulina, potatoes, black sesame seeds,
walnuts, and flax seeds are recommended. Jing tonics
may also be used. These include deer antler, dodder
seeds, processed rehmannia, longevity soup, mussels,
and chicken.

Preventive health practices such as healthy diet,
daily exercise, stress management, and control of
lifestyle habits such as smokingand drinking, can
lengthen the life span and improve the quality of life as
people age. Exercise can improve the appetite, the health
of the bones, the emotional and mental outlook, and the
digestion and circulation.
Drinking plenty of fluids aids in maintaining healthy
skin, good digestion, and proper elimination of wastes.
Up to eight glasses of water should be consumed daily,
along with plenty of herbal teas, diluted fruit and veg-
etable juices, and fresh fruits and vegetables with high
water content.
Because of a decrease in the sense of taste, older
people often increase their intake of salt, which can con-
tribute to high blood pressure and nutrient loss. Use of
sugar is also increased. Seaweeds and small amounts of
honey can be used as replacements.
Alcohol, nicotine, and caffeineall have potential
damaging effects, and should be limited or completely
eliminated from consumption.
A diet high in fiber and low in fat is recommended.
Processed foods should be replaced by complex carbohy-
drates, such as whole grains. If chewing becomes a prob-
lem, there should be an increased intake of protein drinks,
freshly juiced fruits and vegetables, and creamed cereals.

Patience Paradox
Agoraphobia
Definition
The word agoraphobia is derived from Greek words
literally meaning “fear of the marketplace.” The term is
used to describe an irrational and often disabling fear of
being out in public.
Description
Agoraphobia is just one type of phobia, or irrational
fear. People with phobiasfeel dread or panic when they
face certain objects, situations, or activities. People with
agoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, but
panic attacks, or panic disorder, are not a requirement
for a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature of
agoraphobia is anxietyabout being in places from which
escape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which
help might be unavailable. The person suffering from
agoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-
tion and may become totally housebound.
Causes and symptoms
Agoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and
it is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans within
their lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women
as in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.
The symptoms of the panic attacks which may
accompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, and
may include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations(a
feeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,
fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid
pulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.
Agoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the
result of a number of physical and environmental factors.
For instance, they have been associated with biochemical
imbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-
ters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. People
who have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-
ping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-
uation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,
irrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-
flicts. All of these factors may play a role to varying
extents in different cases of agoraphobia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 272
Agoraphobia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72  Diagnosis
People who suffer from panic attacks should discuss
the problem with a physician. The doctor can diagnose
the underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make sure
the symptoms aren’t related to some other underlying
medical condition.
The doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia
based primarily on the patient’s description of his or her
symptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences
anxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help is
unavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.
While many people are somewhat apprehensive in these
situations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’s
active avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or her
ability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.
Treatment
Treatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both
medication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients can
benefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-
line (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
such as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-
line (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panic
attacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben-
zodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon-
azepam (Klonipin).
The mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other
phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech-
nique that is often employed is called desensitization.
The patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu-
ally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help of
breathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope with
the situation. This helps break the mental connection
between the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic.
Patients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori-
ented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotional
conflicts with a therapist or support group.
Prognosis
With proper medication and psychotherapy, 90% of
patients will find significant improvement in their symp-
toms.

AIDS
Definition
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an
infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficien-
cyvirus (HIV). It was first recognized in the United States
in 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of infection with the
HIV virus, which may not cause recognizable disease for a
long period after the initial exposure (latency). No vaccine
is currently available to prevent HIV infection. At present,
all forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving the
quality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing or
halting the replication of the virus and treating or prevent-
ing infections and cancers that take advantage of a per-
son’s weakened immune system.
Description
AIDS is considered one of the most devastating public
health problems in recent history. In June 2000, the Centers
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	73
AIDS
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 73  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that
120,223 (includes only those cases in areas that have confi-
dential HIV reporting) in the United States are HIV-posi-
tive, and 311,701 are living with AIDS (includes only those
cases where vital status is known). Of these patients, 44%
are gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous
drug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-
ly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-
tion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide were
living with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million being
newly infected that year. Most of these cases are in the
developing countries of Asia and Africa.
Risk factors
AIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk
factors for HIV transmission vary according to category:
• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who
do not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-
mous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and
those who have sex with a partner with symptoms of
advanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-
mitted diseases(STDs). In the United States and
Europe, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-
tion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas in
Africa, the disease is spread primarily through sexual
intercourse among heterosexuals.
• Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers include
women married to bisexual men or men who have an
abnormal blood condition called hemophiliaand
require blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, and
women living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIV
infection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-
mitting the disease to the child are higher in women in
advanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increases
the risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-
dine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decrease
the risk of transmission to the baby.
• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.
With the introduction of blood product screening in the
mid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in blood
transfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-
fused. With respect to HIV transmission among drug
abusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-
tions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number of
persons who share a needle, and the number of AIDS
cases in the local population.
• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present
studies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-
dle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased if
the injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-
tion, in combination with other medication.
HIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-
al non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-
sucking insects such as mosquitoes.
AIDS in women
AIDS in women is a serious public health concern.
Women exposed to HIV infection through heterosexual
contact are the most rapidly growing risk group in the
United States population. The percentage of AIDS cases
diagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in
1999. Women diagnosed with AIDS may not live as long
as men, although the reasons for this finding are unclear.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 74  AIDS in children
Since AIDS can be transmitted from an infected moth-
er to the child during pregnancy, during the birth process, or
through breast milk, all infants born to HIV-positive moth-
ers are a high-risk group. As of 2000, it was estimated that
87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%
of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born
to HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.
AIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of deathin chil-
dren between one and four years of age. The interval
between exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS is
shorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIV
have a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a year
and dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-
gresses more slowly; the average child patient survives to
seven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.
Causes and symptoms
Because HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS
is a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organ
systems. HIV attacks the body through three disease
processes: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-
vous system dysfunction.
Immunodeficiency describes the condition in which
the body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is
not functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency
results from the way that the virus binds to a protein called
CD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain
subtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4
cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the
virus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor
called a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of
the virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-
lar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showed
that defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)
cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.
Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-
ment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of the
CCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.
Once HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-
cellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-
pletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-
cytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of

ding on the surface of the lymphocyte (right of center).(Photograph by Scott Camazir, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 75  the remaining CD4 cells. Because the immune system
cells are destroyed, many different types of infections
and cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened
immune system (opportunistic) can develop.
Autoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s
immune system produces antibodies that work against its
own cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in
response to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, protein
or particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-
duces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-
essary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Once
bound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal from
the body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. Some
AIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-related
thrombocytopeniapurpura (ITP), in which the number
of blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.
As of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how
HIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can cause
damage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theory
is that, once infected with HIV, one type of immune sys-
tem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxin
that harms the nervous system.
The course of AIDS generally progresses through
three stages, although not all patients will follow this
progression precisely:
Acute retroviral syndrome
Acute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe
a group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosis
and that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%
of all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients are
not recognized as infected during this phase and may not
seek medical attention. The symptoms may include
fever,fatigue, muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive
disturbances, weight loss, skin rashes,headache, and
chronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).
Approximately 25-33% of patients will experience a
form of meningitisduring this phase in which the mem-
branes that cover the brain and spinal cord become
inflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops between
one and six weeks after infection and lasts for two to
three weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate
the presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the
viral p24 antigen in the blood.
Latency period
After the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes
during the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease
becomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before
symptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,
the virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, where
it may cause one or more of the following conditions:PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).
Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-
dition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painless
swellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.
The lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGL
are those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.
PGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.
CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will
develop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general
weakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food
malabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-
lism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting or
wasting syndrome.
OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the
course of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeast
infection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,
or other infections of the mouth; diarrheaand other gas-
trointestinal symptoms that cause malnutritionand
weight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and
degeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.
HIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss
of strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness or
burning sensations in the feet or lower legs.
Late-stage disease (AIDS)
AIDS is usually marked by a very low number of
CD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequency
of opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitor
the number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in the
patient’s blood in order to assess the progression of the
disease and the effectiveness of different medications.
About 10% of infected individuals never progress to this
overt stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-
gressors.
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s
CD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm
3
, he or
she is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. The
infectious organisms may include the following:
• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated
with AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia(PCP).
PCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of
AIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’s
prognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeast
infection of the mouth (candidiasisor thrush) and
cryptococcal meningitis.
• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosisis a common opportunistic
infection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-
zoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasis
and cryptosporidiosis.
• Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may develop tuberculo-
sisor MAC infections. MAC infections are caused by
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 276
AIDS
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 76  Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and occur in
about 40% of AIDS patients. It is rare until CD4+
counts falls below 50 cells/mm
3
.
• Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacterial
infections of the skin and digestive tract.
• Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to
cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),
varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-
gressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem, cere-
brum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathy
or PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-defining illness
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-
PLICATIONS.
AIDS dementiacomplex is usually a late
complication of the disease. It is unclear whether it is
caused by the direct effects of the virus on the brain or by
intermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is marked
by loss of reasoning ability, loss of memory, inability to
concentrate, apathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadi-
ness or weakness in walking. Some patients also develop
seizures. There are no specific treatments for AIDS
dementia complex.
MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in
late-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-
cles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-
like pains in the joints.
ORAL SYMPTOMS.In addition to thrush and painful
ulcers in the mouth, patients may develop a condition
called hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This condition is
also regarded by the CDC as an indicator of AIDS. Hairy
leukoplakia is a white area of diseased tissue on the
tongue that may be flat or slightly raised. It is caused by
the Epstein-Barr virus.

OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS CAUSED BY AIDS
Because the immune system cells are destroyed by the AIDS virus, many different types of infections and cancers can devel-
op, taking advantage of a person’s weakened immune system.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 77  AIDS-RELATED CANCERS.Patients with late-stage
AIDS may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma(KS), a skin
tumor that primarily affects homosexual men. KS is the
most common AIDS-related malignancy. It is character-
ized by reddish-purple blotches or patches (brownish in
African-Americans) on the skin or in the mouth. About
40% of patients with KS develop symptoms in the diges-
tive tract or lungs. KS may be caused by a herpes virus-
like sexually transmitted disease agent rather than HIV.
The second most common form of cancerin AIDS
patients is a tumor of the lymphatic system (lymphoma).
AIDS-related lymphomas often affect the central nervous
system and develop very aggressively.
KEY TERMS
Acute retroviral syndrome—A group of symptoms
resembling mononucleosis that often are the first
sign of HIV infection in 50-70% of all patients and
45-90% of women.
AIDS dementia complex—A type of brain dysfunc-
tion caused by HIV infection that causes difficulty
thinking, confusion, and loss of muscular coordi-
nation.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body to
produce antibody.
Autoimmunity—A condition in which the body’s
immune system produces antibodies in response to
its own tissues or blood components instead of for-
eign particles or microorganisms.
CCR5—A chemokine receptor; defects in its struc-
ture caused by genetic mutation cause the progres-
sion of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.
CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood,
sometimes called the T4 antigen, that is present on
the surface of 65% of immune cells. The HIV virus
infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, and as a
result, depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natur-
al killer cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood.
Most of the damage to an AIDS patient’s immune
system is done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+
lymphocytes.
Chemokine receptor—A receptor on the surface of
some types of immune cells that helps to mediate
entry of HIV into the cell.
Hairy leukoplakia of the tongue—A white area of
diseased tissue on the tongue that may be flat or
slightly raised. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus
and is an important diagnostic sign of AIDS.
Hemophilia—Any of several hereditary blood coag-
ulation disorders occurring almost exclusively in
males. Because blood does not clot properly, even
minor injuries can cause significant blood loss that
may require a blood transfusion, with its associated
minor risk of infection.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis-
sible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two
forms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-
es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and South
America, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, which
is chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-
covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-
1 and may also have a longer latency period.
Immunodeficient—A condition in which the body’s
immune response is damaged, weakened, or is not
functioning properly.
Kaposi’s sarcoma—A cancer of the connective tis-
sue that produces painless purplish red (in people
with light skin) or brown (in people with dark skin)
blotches on the skin. It is a major diagnostic marker
of AIDS.
Latent period—Also called incubation period, the
time between infection with a disease-causing
agent and the development of disease.
Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that is
important in the formation of antibodies and that
can be used to monitor the health of AIDS patients.
Invasive cancer of the cervix (related to certain types
of human papilloma virus [HPV]) is an important diag-
nostic marker of AIDS in women.
Diagnosis
Because HIV infection produces such a wide range
of symptoms, the CDC has drawn up a list of 34 condi-
tions regarded as defining AIDS. The physician will use
the CDC list to decide whether the patient falls into one
of these three groups:
• definitive diagnoses with or without laboratory evi-
dence of HIV infection

AIDS
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 78  • definitive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of HIV
infection
• presumptive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of
HIV infection
Physical findings
Almost all the symptoms of AIDS can occur with
other diseases. The general physical examinationmay
range from normal findings to symptoms that are closely
associated with AIDS. These symptoms are hairy leuko-
plakia of the tongue and Kaposi’s sarcoma. When the
KEY TERMS
Lymphoma—A cancerous tumor in the lymphatic
system that is associated with a poor prognosis in
AIDS patients.
Macrophage—A large white blood cell, found pri-
marily in the bloodstream and connective tissue,
that helps the body fight off infections by ingesting
the disease-causing organism. HIV can infect and
kill macrophages.
Monocyte—A large white blood cell that is formed
in the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of the
white blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.
Mycobacterium avium(MAC) infection—A type of
opportunistic infection that occurs in about 40% of
AIDS patients and is regarded as an AIDS-defining
disease.
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors—
The newest class of antiretroviral drugs that work by
inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme neces-
sary for HIV replication.
Nucleoside analogues—The first group of effective
anti-retroviral medications. They work by interfering
with the AIDS virus’ synthesis of DNA.
Opportunistic infection—An infection by organ-
isms that usually don’t cause infection in people
whose immune systems are working normally.
Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL)—A
condition in which HIV continues to produce
chronic painless swellings in the lymph nodes dur-
ing the latency period.
Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia (PCP)—An oppor-
tunistic infection caused by a fungus that is a major
cause of death in patients with late-stage AIDS.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML)—A disease caused by a virus that destroys
white matter in localized areas of the brain. It is
regarded as an AIDS-defining illness.
Protease inhibitors—The second major category of
drug used to treat AIDS that works by suppressing
the replication of the HIV virus.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, different
from bacteria (prokaryotic).
Retrovirus—A virus that contains a unique enzyme
called reverse transcriptase that allows it to repli-
cate within new host cells.
T cells—Lymphocytes that originate in the thymus
gland. T cells regulate the immune system’s
response to infections, including HIV. CD4 lympho-
cytes are a subset of T lymphocytes.
Thrush—A yeast infection of the mouth character-
ized by white patches on the inside of the mouth
and cheeks.

overall pattern of symptoms rather than any one finding.
Laboratory tests for HIV infection
BLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY).The first blood test for
AIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients who
are being tested for HIV infection are usually given an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for the
presence of HIV antibody in their blood. Positive ELISA
results are then tested with a Western blot or immunofluo-
rescence (IFA) assay for confirmation. The combination
of the ELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9%
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	79
AIDS
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 79  accurate in detecting HIV infection within four to eight
weeks following exposure. The polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) test can be used to detect the presence of viral
nucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patients
who have false-negative results on the ELISA and West-
ern blot tests. These tests are also used to detect viruses
and bacterium other than HIV and AIDS.
OTHER LABORATORY TESTS.In addition to diagnos-
tic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used to
track the course of AIDS in patients that have already
been diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral load
tests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of 
2-
microglobulin (
2M).
Doctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the
presence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis-
ease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples of
cerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques,
such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computed
tomography scans(CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-related
cancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the central
nervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stool
samples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites.
AIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilisand
other sexually transmitted diseases.
Diagnosis in children
Diagnostic blood testing in children older than 18
months is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening
confirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag-
nosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,
and p24 antigen testing.
In terms of symptoms, children are less likely than
adults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev-
er, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequent
illness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,
failure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Children
with AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-
tions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related brain
disorders than are HIV-positive adults.
Treatment
Treatment for AIDS covers four considerations:
TREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND
MALIGNANCIES.
Most AIDS patients require complex
long-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-
eases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-
opment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-
related malignancies in the central nervous system are
usually treated with radiation therapy. Cancers else-
where in the body are treated with chemotherapy.
PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS.
Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is
given to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of
Pneumocystispneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200
cells/mm
3
or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush
should be given prophylactic medications. The three
drugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-
sone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years
researchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV
replication, as distinct from treating its effects on the
body. These drugs fall into three classes:
• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering
with the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-
ed cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. These
drugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-
dine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-
dine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).
•Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effective
against HIV strains that have developed resistance to
nucleoside analogues, and are often used in combination
with them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-
avir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.
• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is
a new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,
nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine and
efavirin.
Treatment guidelines for these agents are in constant
change as new medications are developed and intro-
duced. Two principles currently guide doctors in working
out drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinations
of drugs rather than one medication alone; and basing
treatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viral
load tests.
STIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.
Because many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-
ly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they may
be given medications to stimulate blood cell production.
Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemic
patients. Patients with low white blood cell counts may
be given filgrastim or sargramostim.
Treatment in women
Treatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-
larly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has been
shown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into
two categories: those intended to help the immune sys-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 280
AIDS
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80  tem and those aimed at paincontrol. Treatments that
may enhance the function of the immune system include
Chinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine,
macrobiotic and other special diets,guided imageryand
creative visualization,homeopathy, and vitamin therapy.
Pain control therapies include hydrotherapy,reiki,
acupuncture,meditation,chiropractictreatments, and
therapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also be
used to help with side effects of the medications used in
the treatment of AIDS.
Prognosis
At the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.
Treatment stresses aggressive combination drug
therapy for those patients with access to the expensive
medications and who tolerate them adequately. The use
of these multi-drug therapies has significantly reduced
the numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting from
AIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potential
exists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using these
and other drug therapies to boost the immune system,
keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-
tic infections and malignancies.
Prognosis after the latency period depends on the
patient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems
affected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-
phomas of the central nervous system die within two to
three months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-
phomas may survive for eight to ten months.
Prevention
As of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against
AIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,
however, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as a
therapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing to
full-blown AIDS.
In the meantime, there are many things that can be
done to prevent the spread of AIDS:
• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals
must be instructed in the proper use of condoms and
urged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk of
HIV infection, condoms are successful in preventing
other sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-
nancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship with
someone, get tested for HIV infection.
• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.
• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-
tored, those individuals who are planning to undergo
major surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of time
to prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion.
• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-
cautions by wearing gloves and masks when handling
body fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.
• If you suspect that you may have become infected, get
tested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively early
on, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi-
nitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital to
let your sexual partners know so that they can be tested
and, if necessary, receive medical attention.

Definition
AIDStests, short for acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome tests, cover a number of different procedures
used in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. These
tests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serology
is the branch of immunology that deals with the contents
and characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear light
yellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cells
form a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in blood
serum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.
Purpose
AIDS serology serves several different purposes.
Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-
firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-
sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-
ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used to
screen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.
In order to understand the different purposes of the
blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to
understand how HIV infection affects human blood and
the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the
blood stream of a new host in the following ways:
• by sexual contact
• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and
urine)
• by transmission during pregnancy,or
• through transfusionof infected blood products
A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme
called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-
in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,
which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white
blood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and
monocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and
kill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-
stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the
AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4
cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called
interleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cells
and B cells) in the human immune system to respond to
infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce as
they normally would in response to the HIV virus, and B
cells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.
Precautions
In some states such as New York, a signed consent
form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As
with all blood tests, healthcare professionals should	always wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked by	the needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, it	may be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous	drug user due to collapsed veins.
Description
Diagnostic tests
Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to
persons in high-risk populations who may have been
exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms of
AIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop a
detectable level of antibody within three months of infec-
tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibody
in the blood is called seroconversion, and persons who
have become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.
It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating
the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating
the presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,
however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it
takes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. More
common are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-
ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-
pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting
99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination to
screen patients and confirm diagnoses.
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).
This type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-
fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test for
HIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well or
beads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,
and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-
pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of a
substance that will cause the enzyme to react by forming
a color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can
measure the color. The name of the test is derived from
the use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-
ond antibody.
The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-
sitive to HIV. Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-
tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-
risk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-
tive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of
the patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is positive, the
result should be confirmed by the Western blot test.
WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot
or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to
confirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,
HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large protein
molecules are suspended in a gel and separated from one
another by running an electric current through the gel).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 282
AIDS tests
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82  The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon or
nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is reacted against
the filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-
cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a colored
patch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot test
for HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricated
strip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s blood
serum and the developing chemicals. About nine different
HIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.
When used in combination with ELISA testing,
Western blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,
yield false negatives in patients with very early HIV
infection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some
patients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method
is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of
Western blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of
HIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-
ing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the
blood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-
scope with ultraviolet light.
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is
used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patients
with false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. These
patients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-
matic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do not
have any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectable
quantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-
tive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for the
very low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted by
blood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between
1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-
sure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’s
blood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV.
This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-
ic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene are
made by separating the two strands of DNA containing
the gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-
merase to make a copy, and then continuously replicating
the copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replace
Western blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-
noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-
sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated
an antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming
majority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA
screening within one to three months of infection. In
addition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of
the genetic sequences in HIV. Since the virus is continual-
ly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield a
false negative in patients with these new variants.
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit contains
multiple components, including material for specimen col-
lection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-
ratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-
seling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.
The results are obtained by the purchaser through a toll
free telephone number using a personal identification
number (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over the
telephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approved
by the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.
Prognostic tests
Blood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed
with HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic
tests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-
sons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longer
before they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patients
are sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomatic
carriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-
uate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.
BLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the
number or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDS
patient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-
ease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are
helping the patient. These cell count tests include:
• Complete blood count(CBC). A CBC is a routine analy-
sis performed on a sample of blood taken from the
patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The mea-

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 83  surements taken in a CBC include a white blood cell count
(WBC), a red blood cell count (RBC), the red cell distribu-
tion width, the hematocrit(ratio of the volume of the red
blood cells to the blood volume), and the amount of hemo-
globin (the blood protein that carries oxygen). Although
CBCs are used on more than just AIDS patients, they can
help the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has an
advanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related signs
in a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp decrease in the
number of blood platelets, and a low level of a certain type
of white blood cell called neutrophils.
• Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type
of white blood cell that is important in the formation
KEY TERMS
Antibody—A protein in the blood that identifies
and helps remove disease organisms or their toxins.
Antibodies are secreted by B cells. AIDS diagnostic
tests work by demonstrating the presence of HIV
antibody in the patient’s blood.
Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body to
produce antibodies.
B cell—A type of white blood cell derived from
bone marrow. B cells are sometimes called B lym-
phocytes. They secrete antibody and have a number
of other complex functions within the human
immune system.
CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood
that is present on the surface of 65% of human T
cells. CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When the
HIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, it
depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killer
cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most of
the damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system is
done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho-
cytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.
Complete blood count (CBC)—A routine analysis
performed on a sample of blood taken from the
patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The
measurements taken in a CBC include a white blood
cell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri-
bution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume of
the red blood cells to the blood volume), and the
amount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car-
ries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used for
many medical reasons and are not used only for
AIDS patients. They can help the doctor determine if
a patient is in advanced stages of the disease.
Electrophoresis—A method of separating complex
protein molecules suspended in a gel by running an
electric current through the gel.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)—A
diagnostic blood test used to screen patients for
AIDS or other viruses. The patient’s blood is mixed
with antigen attached to a plastic tube or bead sur-
face. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is
added, and excess proteins are removed. A second
antibody coupled to an enzyme is added, followed
by a chemical that will cause a color reaction that
can be measured by a special instrument.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis-
sible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two
forms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-
es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and South
America, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, which
is chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-
covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-
1, but may also have a longer latency period.
Immunofluorescent assay (IFA)—A blood test
sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of
using the Western blotting. In an IFA test, HIV anti-
gen is mixed with a fluorescent compound and then
with a sample of the patient’s blood. If HIV antibody
is present, the mixture will fluoresce when exam-
ined under ultraviolet light.
Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that is
important in the formation of antibodies. Doctors
of an immune response. Because HIV targets CD4+
lymphocytes, their number in the patient’s blood can
be used to track the course of the infection. This blood
cell count is considered the most accurate indicator
for the presence of an opportunistic infection in an
AIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count
is obtained by multiplying the patient’s white blood
cell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytes
among the white blood cells, and multiplying the
result by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing the
CD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300
CD+4 lymphocytes in 1 cubic millimeter (mm
3
) of
blood indicates that the patient is vulnerable to some
opportunistic infections.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 84  • CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think that
this is a more accurate test than the absolute count
because the percentage does not depend on a manual
calculation of the number of types of different white
blood cells. A white blood cell count that is broken
down into categories in this way is called a WBC dif-
ferential.
It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients to
measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.
Experts consulted by the United States Public Health
Service recommend the following frequency of serum
testing based on the patient’s CD4+ level:
• CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm

: Every six months.
KEY TERMS
can monitor the health of AIDS patients by measur-
ing the number or proportion of certain types of
lymphocytes in the patient’s blood.
Macrophage—A large white blood cell, found pri-
marily in the bloodstream and connective tissue,
that helps the body fight off infections by ingesting
the disease organism. HIV can infect and kill
macrophages.
Monocyte—A large white blood cell that is formed
in the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of the
white blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.
Opportunistic infection—An infection that devel-
ops only when a person’s immune system is weak-
ened, as happens to AIDS patients.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—A test performed
to evaluate false-negative results to the ELISA and
Western blot tests. In PCR testing, numerous copies
of a gene are made by separating the two strands of
DNA containing the gene segment, marking its
location, using DNA polymerase to make a copy,
and then continuously replicating the copies. The
amplification of gene sequences that are associated
with HIV allows for detection of the virus by this
method.
Retrovirus—A virus that contains a unique enzyme
called reverse transcriptase that allows it to repli-
cate within new host cells.
Seroconversion—The change from HIV- negative to
HIV-positive status during blood testing. Persons
who are HIV-positive are called seroconverters.
Serology—The analysis of the contents and proper-
ties of blood serum.
Serum—The part of human blood that remains liq-
uid when blood cells form a clot. Human blood
serum is clear light yellow in color.
T cells—Lymphocytes that originate in the thymus
gland. T cells regulate the immune system’s
response to infections, including HIV. CD4 lympho-
cytes are a subset of T lymphocytes.
Viral load test—A new blood test for monitoring the
speed of HIV replication in AIDS patients. The viral
load test is based on PCR techniques and supple-
ments the CD4+ cell count tests.
Western blot—A technique developed in 1979 that
is used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is puri-
fied by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to a
nylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is
reacted against the filter, followed by treatment with
developing chemicals that allow HIV antibody to
show up as a colored patch or blot. If the patient is
HIV-positive, there will be stripes at specific loca-
tions for two or more viral proteins. A negative
result is blank.
WBC differential—A white blood cell count in
which the technician classifies the different white
blood cells by type as well as calculating the num-
ber of each type. A WBC differential is necessary to
calculate the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count.
• CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm
3
: Every three
months.
• CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm
3
: Every three months.
When the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm
3
,
the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen to
protect him or her against opportunistic infections.
HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS.Another type of blood test
for monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It sup-
plements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor the
extent of the patient’s loss of immune function, but not
the speed of HIV replication in the body. The viral load
test is based on PCR techniques and can measure the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	85
AIDS tests
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 85  number of copies of HIV nucleic acids. Successive test
results for a given patient’s viral load are calculated on a
base 10 logarithmic scale.
BETA
2-MICROGLOBULIN (
2M).Beta
2-microglobulin
is a protein found on the surface of all human cells with
a nucleus. It is released into the blood when a cell dies.
Although rising blood levels of 
2M are found in
patients with cancerand other serious diseases, a rising

2M blood level can be used to measure the progression
of AIDS.
P24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral
core of HIV, p24 is a protein that can be measured by
the ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to
measure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-
tions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful in
detecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-
er, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of persons
infected with HIV.
GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic
testing can help determine whether specific gene muta-
tions, common in people with HIV, are causing drug
resistance and drug failure. The test looks for specific
genetic mutations of within the virus that are known to
cause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.
For example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine
(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that have
a mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-
scriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V
(MV, methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-
tance test shows a mutation at position M184V, it is like-
ly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely to
respond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are only
effective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-
tion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per
milliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually
between $300 and $500, is usually now covered by
many insurance plans.
PHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-
typic testing directly measures the sensitivity of a
patient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.
To do this, it measures the concentration of a drug
required to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. This
is the same method used by researchers to determine
whether a drug might be effective against HIV before
using it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is a
more direct measurement of resistance than genotypic
testing. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-
ing does not require a high viral load but it is recom-
mended that persons already be taking antiretroviral
drugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now
covered by many insurance plans.
AIDS serology in children
Children born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire
the infection through the mother’s placenta or during the
birth process. Public health experts recommend the test-
ing and monitoring of all children born to mothers with
HIV. Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months
is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-
firmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosed
by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24
antigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician to
identify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and
95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.
Preparation
Preparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS
diagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take the
patient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-
stances into account and to provide counseling before and
after testing. Patients are generally better able to cope with
the results if the doctor has spent some time with them
before the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIV
infection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type of
informational counseling before performing the tests.
Aftercare
If the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-
itive, he or she will need counseling, information, referral
for treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel the
patient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-
selor to discuss the results of the blood tests with the
patient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional and
psychological status, including the possibility of violent
behavior and the availability of a support network.
Risks
The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to
disclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to any
physical risks connected with blood testing. Some
patients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-
nosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,
resources, belief system, and similar factors.
Normal results
Normal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and
PCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.
Normal results for blood cell counts:
• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the
white blood cells.
• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.

Alanine aminotransferase test
Definition
The alanine aminotransferase test, also known as
ALT, is one of a group of tests known as liver function
tests(or LFTs) and is used to monitor damage to the liver.
Purpose
ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities.
Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also found
in muscle, tests indicating elevated AST levels might also
indicate muscle damage. However, other tests, such as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	87
Alanine aminotransferase test
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 87  the levels of the MB fraction of creatine kinase should
indicate whether the abnormal test levels are because of
muscle or liver damage.
Description
The alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can reveal
liver damage. It is probably the most specific test for
liver damage. However, the severity of the liver damage
is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since the
amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higher
ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,
ALT levels may experience serious liver damage without
an increase in ALT.
Nevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,
because ALT levels are elevated in most patients with
liver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily
indicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may
indicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT
levels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-
tant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,
within a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater
for AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from
alcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be
gleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.
Preparation
No special preparations are necessary for this test.
Aftercare
This test involves blood being drawn, probably from
a vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep the
wound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-
dage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report any
unusual symptoms to their physician.
Normal results
Normal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,
and should be available to your physician at the time of
the test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-
cates many laboratories find values from approximately
seven to 50 IU/L to be normal.
Abnormal results
Low levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may
indicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000
IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-
ins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually
resulting from very low blood pressure or a heart
attack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L that
resolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the
bile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)
may support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.
It is important to note that persons with normal liv-
ers may have slightly elevated levels of ALT. This is a
normal finding.

Albinism
Definition
Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth,
characterized by a lack of pigment that normally gives
color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of albinism
exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying
degrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may
be accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin
cancerlater in life.
Description
Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five
people per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.
Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; for
example, albinism is found in about 20 out of every
100,000 people in southern Nigeria.
There are 10 types of the most common form of the
condition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” which
affects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,
hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People
with a less severe form are born with white hair and
skin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone
with oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal
flickering eye movements (nystagmus) and sensitivity
to bright light. There may be other eye problems as
well, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes
(strabismus).
The second most common type of the condition is
known as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lack
color; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms of
ocular albinism; some types cause more problems—
especially eye problems—than others.

Albinism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88  Causes and symptoms
Every cell in the body contains a matched pair of
genes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act as a
sort of “blueprint” that guides the development of a fetus.
Albinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw in
one or more of the genes that are responsible for direct-
ing the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment). As a
result, little or no pigment is made, and the child’s skin,
eyes and hair may be colorless.
In most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the child
inherits flawed genes for making melanin from both par-
ents. Because the task of making melanin is complex,
there are many different types of albinism, involving a
number of different genes.
It’s also possible to inherit one normal gene and one
albinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene provides
enough information in its cellular blueprint to make
some pigment, and the child will have normal skin and
eye color. They “carry” one gene for albinism. About one
in 70 people are albinism carriers, with one flawed gene
but no symptoms; they have a 50% chance of passing the
albinism gene to their child. However, if both parents are
KEY TERMS
Amino acids—Natural substances that are the
building blocks of protein. The body breaks down
the protein in food into amino acids, and then uses
these amino acids to create other proteins. The body
also changes amino acids into melanin pigment.
Astigmatism—An eye condition in which the lens
doesn’t focus light evenly on the retina, leading to
problems with visual sharpness.
Carrier—A person with one normal gene and one
faulty gene, who can pass on a condition to others
without actually having symptoms.
DNA—The abbreviation for “deoxyribonucleic
acid,” the primary carrier of genetic information
found in the chromosomes of almost all organisms.
The entwined double structure allows the chromo-
somes to be copied exactly during cell division.
DOPA—The common name for a natural chemical
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) made by the body
during the process of making melanin.
Enzyme—A protein that helps the body convert one
chemical substance to another.
Gene—The basic unit of genetic material carried in
a particular place on a chromosome. Genes are
passed on from parents to child when the sperm
and egg unite during conception.
Hairbulb—The root of a strand of hair from which
the color develops.
Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)—A rare type
of albinism characterized by a problem with blood
clotting and a buildup of waxy material in lungs
and intestines.
Melanin—Pigment made in the hair, skin and eyes.
Nystagmus—An involuntary back-and-forth move-
ment of the eyes that is often found in albinism.
Strabismus—Crossed or “lazy” eyes, often found in
albinism.
Tyrosine—A protein building block found in a wide
variety of foods that is used by the body to make
melanin.
Tyrosinase—An enzyme in a pigment cell which
helps change tyrosine to DOPA during the process
of making melanin.
carriers with one flawed gene each, they have a 1 in 4
chance of passing on both copies of the flawed gene to
the child, who will have albinism. (There is also a type of
ocular albinism that is carried on the X chromosome and
occurs almost exclusively in males because they have
only one X chromosome and, therefore, no other gene for
the trait to override the flawed one.)
Symptoms of albinism can involve the skin, hair,
and eyes. The skin, because it contains little pigment,
appears very light, as does the hair.
Although people with albinism may experience a vari-
ety of eye problems, one of the myths about albinism is that
it causes people to have pink or red eyes. In fact, people
with albinism can have irises varying from light gray or
blue to brown. (The iris is the colored portion of the eye
that controls the size of the pupil, the opening that lets light
into the eye.) If people with albinism seem to have reddish
eyes, it’s because light is being reflected from the back of
the eye (retina) in much the same way as happens when
people are photographed with an electronic flash.
People with albinism may have one or more of the
following eye problems:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	89
AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 89  • They may be very far-sighted or near-sighted, and may
have other defects in the curvature of the lens of the eye
(astigmatism) that cause images to appear unfocused.
• They may have a constant, involuntary movement of
the eyeball called nystagmus.
• They may have problems in coordinating the eyes in fix-
ing and tracking objects (strabismus), which may lead to
an appearance of having “crossed eyes” at times. Stra-
bismus may cause some problems with depth percep-
tion, especially at close distances.
• They may be very sensitive to light (photophobia)
because their irises allow “stray” light to enter their eyes.
It’s a common misconception that people with albinism
shouldn’t go out on sunny days, but wearing sunglasses
can make it possible to go outside quite comfortably.
In addition to the characteristically light skin and
eye problems, people with a rare form of albinism called
Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) also have a greater
tendency to have bleeding disorders, inflammation of the
large bowel (colitis), lung (pulmonary) disease, and kid-
ney (renal) problems.	Diagnosis
It’s not always easy to diagnose the exact type of
albinism a person has; there are two tests available that
can identify only two types of the condition. Recently, a
blood test has been developed that can identify carriers
of the gene for some types of albinism; a similar test dur-
ing amniocentesiscan diagnose some types of albinism
in an unborn child. A chorionic villus samplingtest dur-
ing the fifth week of pregnancymay also reveal some
types of albinism.
The specific type of albinism a person has can be
determined by taking a good family history and examin-
ing the patient and several close relatives.
The “hairbulb pigmentation test” is used to identify
carriers by incubating a piece of the person’s hair in a
solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the body
uses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means the
hair is making melanin (a “positive” test); light hair
means there is no melanin. This test is the source of the
names of two types of albinism: “ty-pos” and “ty-neg.”
The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulb
pigmentation test. It measures the rate at which hair con-

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 90  verts tyrosine into another chemical (DOPA), which is
then made into pigment. The hair converts tyrosine with
the help of a substance called “tyrosinase.” In some types
of albinism, tyrosinase doesn’t do its job, and melanin
production breaks down.
Treatment
There is no treatment that can replace the lack of
melanin that causes the symptoms of albinism. Doctors
can only treat, not cure, the eye problems that often
accompany the lack of skin color. Glasses are usually
needed and can be tinted to ease painfrom too much
sunlight. There is no cure for involuntary eye movements
(nystagmus), and treatments for focusing problems
(surgery or contact lenses) are not effective in all cases.
Crossed eyes (strabismus) can be treated during
infancy, using eye patches, surgery or medicine injec-
tions. Treatment may improve the appearance of the
eye, but it can do nothing to cure the underlying con-
dition.
Patients with albinism should avoid excessive expo-
sure to the sun, especially between 10 
A.M. and 2 P.M.If
exposure can’t be avoided, they should use UVA-UVB
sunblocks with an SPF of at least 20. Taking beta-
carotene may help provide some skin color, although it
doesn’t protect against sun exposure.
Prognosis
In the United States, people with this condition
can expect to have a normal lifespan. People with
albinism may experience some social problems
because of a lack of understanding on the part of oth-
ers. When a member of a normally dark-skinned ethnic
group has albinism, he or she may face some very
complex social challenges.
One of the greatest health hazards for people with
albinism is excessive exposure to sun without protec-
tion, which could lead to skin cancer. Wearing opaque
clothes and sunscreen rated SPF 20, people with
albinism can safely work and play outdoors safely even
during the summer.
Prevention
Genetic counselingis very important to prevent fur-
ther occurrences of the condition.

Alcohol-related 
neurologic disease
Definition
Alcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic
effects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on which
nerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol can
have far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain,
peripheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem-
ory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso-
ry deficits. These different effects can be grouped in
three main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acute
effects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud-
denly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to
long-term or chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol-related
neurologic disease includes Wernicke-Korsakoff dis-
ease, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, alcoholic
myopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal
syndrome with seizures and deliriumtremens, and fetal
alcohol syndrome.
Description
Acute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-
ness (intoxication) or even death, and chronic or long-
term abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage to
virtually any level of the nervous system. Any given

or multiple conditions, depending on the genes they
have inherited, how well nourished they are, and other
environmental factors, such as exposure to other drugs
or toxins.
Neurologic complications of alcohol abuse may also
result from nutritional deficiency, because alcoholics
tend to eat poorly and may become depleted of thiamine
or other vitaminsimportant for nervous system function.
Persons who are intoxicated are also at higher risk for
head injuryor for compression injuries of the peripheral
nerves. Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especially
sodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon-
tine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in which
nerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli-
cating alcoholic cirrhosismay cause dementia, deliri-
um, and movement disorder.
Causes and symptoms
When a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed by
blood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidly
throughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crosses
the blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole-
cules from escaping from the blood vessel to the brain
tissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at blood
ethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL in
people who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor,coma,or
even death from respiratory depression and low blood
pressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.
Although alcohol is broken down by the liver, the
toxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely a
direct result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdown
products. The fatal dose varies widely because people
who drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects of
alcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol tolerance
results in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol to
achieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-
hood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high and
potentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularly
true when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting
decreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes even
higher blood alcohol levels.
When a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,
withdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increased
excitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-
um tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eight
hours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72
hours after abstinence. They include body shaking
(tremulousness),insomnia, agitation, confusion, hear-
ing voices or seeing images that are not really there
(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-
fuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol-
related seizures may also occur without withdrawal,
such as during active heavy drinking or after more than a
week without alcohol.
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-
ciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen in
people who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-
amine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that prevents
the absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-
tion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;
the symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-
orientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.
Examination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,
including jerking of the eyes (nystagmus) and double
vision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.
People may have trouble coordinating their leg move-
ments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not given
promptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-
por, coma, and death.
If thiamine is given and death averted,Korsakoff’s
syndromemay develop in some patients, who suffer
from memory impairment that leaves them unable to
remember events for a period of a few years before the
onset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to learn
new information (anterograde amnesia). Most patients
have very limited insight into their memory dysfunction
and have a tendency to make up explanations for events
they have forgotten (confabulation).
Severe alcoholismcan cause cerebellar degenera-
tion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions of
the brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-
mis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, and
an inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. The
gait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, but
may be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenly
worsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.
Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to
alcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanol
retards fetal growth and development. Affected infants
often have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip,
flat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size.
Almost half are mentally retarded, and most others are
mildly impaired intellectually or have problems with
speech, learning, and behavior.
Alcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to
breakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholic
rhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males are
affected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathy
four times as often as females. Breakdown of muscle tis-
sue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly during binge
drinking or in the first days of alcohol withdrawal. In its
mildest form, this breakdown may cause no noticeable
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 292
Alcohol-related neurologic disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 92  symptoms, but may be detected by a temporary elevation
in blood levels of an enzyme found predominantly in
muscle, the MM fraction of creatine kinase.
The severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy is
associated with the sudden onset of muscle pain,
swelling, and weakness; a reddish tinge in the urine
caused by myoglobin, a breakdown product of muscle
excreted in the urine; and a rapid rise in muscle enzymes
in the blood. Symptoms usually worsen over hours to a
few days, and then improve over the next week to 10
days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Muscle
symptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swelling
may selectively involve the calves or other muscle
groups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholic
myopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, which
may occur when people drink so much that they com-
press a muscle group with their body weight for a long
time without moving, or by withdrawal seizures with
generalized muscle activity.
In patients who abuse alcohol over many years,
chronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males and
females are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-
less weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk
and the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,
shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops
gradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms of
acute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,
may be striking. The nerves of the extremities may also
begin to break down, a condition known as alcoholic
peripheral neuropathy, which can add to the person’s
difficulty in moving.
The way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is
still not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include
muscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-
cium, potassium, or other minerals; impaired muscle
energy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.
Alcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by the
liver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanol
is converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletal
muscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver function
may affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing the
amount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-
longed activity. Because not enough sugar is available to
supply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken
down as an alternate energy source. However, toxic
effects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself
rather than of its breakdown products.
Although alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-
tribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the
motor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholic
neuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.
Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain
in the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with
walking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases but
numbness increases.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease
depends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and
signs in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possible
causes should be excluded by the appropriate tests,
which may include blood chemistry,thyroid function
tests, brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT
(computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinal
fluid analysis.
Acute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by
finding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatine
kinase and other blood enzymes released from injured
muscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of muscle
for microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows the
scattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-
tors must rule out other acquired causes of muscle
breakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such as
heroin,cocaine, or amphetamines; trauma with crush
injury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or an
underlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates or
lipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatine
kinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-
phy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography
(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholic
myopathy or neuropathy.
Treatment
Acute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium
tremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-
itor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure
that may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat-
ing may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondary
low blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben-
zodiazepinessuch as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergic
antagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago-
nists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome is
rapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may
intervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patients
admitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well as
all patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should be
given intravenous thiamine.
Withdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe-
cific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep-
ticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption)
should be treated vigorously. Acute alcoholic myopathy
with myoglobinuria requires monitoring and mainte-
nance of kidney function, and correction of imbalances
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	93
Alcohol-related neurologic disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 93  in blood chemistry including potassium, phosphate, and
magnesium levels.
Chronic alcoholic myopathy and other chronic con-
ditions are treated by correcting associated nutritional
deficiencies and maintaining a diet adequate in protein
and carbohydrate. The key to treating any alcohol-related
disease is helping the patient overcome alcohol addic-
tion. Behavioral measures and social supports may be
needed in patients who develop broad problems in their
thinking abilities (dementia) or remain in a state of con-
fusion and disorientation (delirium). People with walk-
ing disturbances may benefit from physical therapy and
assistive devices. Doctors may also prescribe drugs to
treat the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy.
Prognosis
Complete recovery from Wernicke’s syndrome may
follow prompt administration of thiamine. However,
repeated episodes of encephalopathy or prolonged alco-
hol abuse may cause persistent dementia or Korsakoff
psychosis. Most patients recover fully from acute alco-
holic myopathy within days to weeks, but severe cases
may be fatal from acute kidney failureand disturbances
in heart rhythm secondary to increased potassium levels.
Recovery from chronic alcoholic myopathy may occur

over weeks to months of abstinence from alcohol and
correction of malnutrition. Cerebellar degeneration and
alcoholic neuropathy may also improve to some extent
with abstinence and balanced diet, depending on the
severity and duration of the condition.
Prevention
Prevention requires abstinence from alcohol. Per-
sons who consume small or moderate amounts of alcohol
might theoretically help prevent nutritional complica-
tions of alcohol use with dietary supplements including
B vitamins. However, proper nutritioncannot protect
against the direct toxic effect of alcohol or of its break-
down products. Patients with any alcohol-related symp-
toms or conditions, pregnant women, and patients with
liver or neurologic disease should abstain completely.
Persons with family history of alcoholism or alcohol-
related conditions may also be at increased risk for neu-
rologic complications of alcohol use.

Definition
The essential feature of alcohol abuse is the mal-
adaptive use of alcohol with recurrent and significant
adverse consequences related to its repeated use. Alco-
holism is the popular term for two disorders, alcohol
abuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of both
these disorders involve repeated life problems that can be
directly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-
ders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-
ual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impact
on society at large.
Description
The effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.
Alcohol affects every body system, causing a wide range
of health problems. Some such problems include poor
nutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance and
walking, liver disease (including cirrhosisand hepatitis),
high blood pressure, muscle weakness (including the
heart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-
ders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinal
inflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problems	with the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-	tent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-	ened bones.
On a personal level, alcoholism results in marital
and other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-
ment,child abuse, and general family dysfunction.
Alcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of
severe social problems including homelessness, murder,
suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-
ing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-
cle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur each
year due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are due
to injuries of some sort. According to a recent special
report prepared for the U.S. Congress by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impact
of alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-
dents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs
our nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-
tion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-
dren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to
17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-
hol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, it
has been estimated that approximately 18 percent of
adults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-
dence a some time during their lives.
Causes and symptoms
There are probably a number of factors that work
together to cause a person to become an alcoholic.
Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-
atives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to
become alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk
holds true even for children who were adopted away
from their biological families at birth and raised in a
non-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge of
their biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More
research is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-
tors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-
lism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-
ing an alcoholic.
The symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down
into two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol
use and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.
Immediate (acute) effects of alcohol use
Alcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The
blood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-
ing the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly
become equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’s
depressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-
ance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	95
Alcoholism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 95  (accounting in part for the increased likelihood of
injury). The affected person may also have impairment of
periperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s
breathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting
may occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed
into the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including the
possibility of pneumonia). Still higher alcohol levels
may result in comaand death.
Effects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism
Long-term use of alcohol affects virtually every
organ system of the body:
• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in
their teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic
blackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantity
of alcohol results in the loss of memory of the time
surrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-
known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overall
sleep quality is affected. Numbness and tinglingmay
occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which can
occur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’s
and Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the low
thiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels found
in alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-
dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficulty
walking, while Korsakoff’s syndromeseverely
affects one’s memory, preventing new learning from
taking place.
• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of
the muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contents
from re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acid
from the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-
gus, burning those tissues, and causing painand
bleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also result
in bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. A
major cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-
orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development of
enlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,
which are called esophageal varices. These varices are
actually developed in response to liver disease, and
are extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.
Diarrheais a common symptom, due to alcohol’s
effect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation of
the pancreas (pancreatitis) is a serious and painful
problem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,
alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,
creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-
ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ is
severely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-
hol interferes with a number of important chemical
processes that also occur in the liver. The liver begins
to enlarge and fill with fat (fatty liver), fibrous scar
tissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and
function (cirrhosis), and the liver may become
inflamed (hepatitis).
• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of
blood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally
large. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-
tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened
immune system. This places alcoholics at increased
risk for infections, and is thought to account in part
for the increased risk of cancerfaced by alcoholics
(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and blood
clotting factors are affected, causing an increased risk
of bleeding.
• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood
pressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins to
increase blood pressure into a dangerous range. High
levels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase the
risk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in an
increase in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,
abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots forming
within the chambers of the heart, and a greatly
increased risk of stroke(due to a blood clot from the
heart entering the circulatory system, going to the
brain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).
• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative
effect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-
ing testicle and ovary size, and interfering with both
sperm and egg production. When pregnancyis
achieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a great
risk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which
causes distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, and
behavioral problems.
Diagnosis
Two different types of alcohol-related difficulties
have been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-
dence, which refers to a person who literally depends on
the use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must be
present to diagnose alcohol dependence:
• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed
to a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase the
dose in order to obtain the desired effect
• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences
unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms when
he or she does not drink alcohol
• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends
(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-
ficult to stop)
• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once
started
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 296

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96  • having large blocks of time taken up by alcohol use
• choosing to drink at the expense of other important
tasks or activities
• drinking despite evidence of negative effects on one’s
health, relationships, education, or job
Alcohol abuserequires that one of the following four
criteria is met. Because of drinking, a person repeatedly:
• fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili-
ties
• physically endangers him or herself, or others (for
example, by drinking when driving)
• gets into trouble with the law
• experiences difficulties in relationships or jobs
Diagnosis is sometimes brought about when family
members call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attention
of a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspicious
when a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins to
experience medical problems related to the use of alco-
hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of a
physician’s patients will be alcoholics.
Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-
logical assessments that try to determine what aspects of
a person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-
hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-
son drinks is of much less importance than determining
how his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-
tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-
lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-
es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-
sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing either
alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.
One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of
alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists
of four questions, with the first letters of each key word
spelling out the word CAGE:
• Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking?
• Have you ever been Annoyedby anyone’s comments
about your drinking?
• Have you ever felt Guiltyabout your drinking?
• Do you ever need an Eye-opener(a morning drink of
alcohol) to start the day)?
Other, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-
mine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.
Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basis
for alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whether
anyone else in the person’s family has ever suffered
from alcoholism.
Physical examinationmay reveal signs suggestive
of alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible network
of enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel
(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen (ascites);
yellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size in
men; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal an
increase in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalities
in the white blood cells (cells responsible for fighting
infection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-
ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.
Treatment
Treatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step
in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification,
involves helping the person stop drinking and ridding his
or her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.
Because the person’s body has become accustomed to
alcohol, the person will need to be supported through
withdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for different
patients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as
measured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and the
length of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-
drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.
Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-
rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness,anxiety, and trem-
bling. This phase is usually over in about three to five
days. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-
cinations(in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-
thing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable
craving for more alcohol, confusion,fever, fast heart rate,
high blood pressure, and delirium(a fluctuating level of
consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severe
symptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens)
are those with other medical problems, including malnu-
trition, liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome. Delirium

patient’s last drink, progressing from the more mild symp-
toms to the more severe, and may last a number of days.
Patients going through only mild withdrawal are sim-
ply monitored carefully to make sure that more severe
symptoms do not develop. No medications are necessary,
however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severe
effects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-
ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and to
avoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high
blood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs called
benzodiazapines are helpful in those patients suffering
from hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids
may need to be given through a vein (intravenously), along
with some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-
amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually
quite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamine
is responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
After cessation of drinking has been accomplished,
the next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-
ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred to
as rehabilitation. The best programs incorporate the
family into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-
edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.
Some therapists believe that family members, in an effort
to deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-
times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-
port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation is
referred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed in
order to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.
Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics
meet regularly and provide support for each other’s
recoveries, are considered some of the best methods of
preventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the
most well-known such group is called Alcoholics
Anonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-
ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing the
destructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-
holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-
coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways in
which the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-
ble, making amends to those people. According to a
recent study reported by the American Psychological
Association (APA), anyone, regardless of his or her
religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefit
from participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-
holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous
(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groups
exceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-
sionals combined.
There are also medications that may help an alco-
holic avoid returning to drinking. These have been used
with variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug
which, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-
tions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.
Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,
can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-
prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of these
medications would be helpful unless the patient was also
willing to work very hard to change his or her behavior.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the
alcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawal
has passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressful
lives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is
sometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments for
alcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. These
include massage,meditation, and hypnotherapy. The
malnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-
tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a
healthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as
vitaminsA, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty
acids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal
treatments include milk thistle(Silybum marianum), which
is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs
are thought to be helpful for the patient suffering through
withdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula
officinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile
(Matricaria recutita), peppermint (Mentha piperita)
yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and valerian (Valeriana
officinalis). Acupunctureis believed to both decrease
withdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’s
chances for continued recovery from alcoholism.
Prognosis
Recovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In
fact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-
aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-
holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because most
researchers in the field believe that since the potential for
alcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological and
psychological makeup, one can never fully recover from
alcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)
is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.
Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics in
stable financial and family situations who have undergone
treatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt to
stop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.
Prevention
Prevention must begin at a relatively young age

important that teenagers who are at high risk for alco-
holism—those with a family history of alcoholism, an
early or frequent use of alcohol, a tendency to drink to
drunkenness, alcohol use that interferes with school
work, a poor family environment, or a history of domes-
tic violence—receive education about alcohol and its
long-term effects. How this is best achieved, without irri-
tating the youngsters and thus losing their attention, is
the subject of continuing debate and study.

Aldolase test
Definition
Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the body,
particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is needed to
trigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus-
cle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to
diagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.
Purpose
Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level
found in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those
muscles attached to bones and whose contractions make
those bones move. When the muscles are diseased or
damaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the cells dete-
riorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-
ing aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring the
amount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of
muscle damage.
As muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels
decrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle
means fewer cells and less aldolase.
Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as
well as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolase
levels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will be
normal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi-
cal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis,
but aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of muscular
disease, such as muscular dystrophy.

Aldolase—An enzyme, found primarily in the
muscle, that helps convert sugar into energy.
Enzyme—A substance needed to trigger specific
chemical reactions.
Neurologic—Having to do with the nervous sys-
tem.
Skeletal muscle—Muscle connected to, and nec-
essary for the movement of, bones.
Aldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac mus-
cle of the heart. Damage or disease to these organs, such
as chronic hepatitis or a heart attack, will also increase
aldolase levels in the blood, but to a lesser degree.
Description
Aldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serum
with a substance with which aldolase is known to trigger
a reaction. The end product of this reaction is measured,
and, from that measurement, the amount of aldolase in
the person’s serum is determined.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml of blood needed for this test, a
healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upper
arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts
a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood
through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of
the sample takes only a few minutes.
The patient should avoid strenuous exerciseand
have nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to ten
hours before this test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.
Normal results
Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levels
and adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based on
the laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
As noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle dis-
eases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s muscu-
lar dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystro-
phy, will increase the aldolase level more than any other
disease.
Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle, such
as injury,gangrene, or an infection, can also increase the
aldolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarily
increase a person’s aldolase level.
Certain medications can increase the aldolase level,
while others can decrease it. To interpret what the results
of the aldolase test mean, a physician will evaluate the
result, the person’s clinical symptoms, and other tests
that are more specific for muscle damage and disease.

Aldosterone assay
Definition
This test measures the levels of aldosterone, a hor-
mone produced by the outer part (cortex) of the two
adrenal glands, organs which sit one on top of each of
the kidneys. Aldosterone regulates the amounts of sodi-
um and potassium in the blood. This helps maintain
water balance and blood volume, which, in turn, affects
blood pressure.
Purpose
Aldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a
condition called aldosteronism, which is caused by
excess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal glands.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2100
Aldosterone assay
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 100  There are two types of aldosteronism: primary and sec-
ondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly caused
by an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s syndrome. Idiopathic
(of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronismis another type
of primary aldosteronism. Secondary aldosteronism is
more common and may occur with congestive heart fail-
ure,cirrhosiswith fluid in the abdominal cavity
(ascites), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,
sodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy.
To differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-
ondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-
formed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,
an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondary
aldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.
Description
Aldosterone testing can be performed on a blood
sample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,
including diet, posture (upright or lying down), and time
of day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosterone
levels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-
term fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over an
entire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-
fering factors and provides a more reliable aldosterone
measurement.
Preparation
Fastingis not required for either the blood sample
or urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-
mal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for at
least two weeks before either test. The doctor should
decide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluid
balance (e.g.,diuretics, antihypertensives, steroids,oral
contraceptives) should be withheld. The test will be
more accurate if these are suspended at least two weeks
before the test. Renin inhibitors (e.g., propranolol)
should not be taken one week before the test, unless per-
mitted by the physician. The patient should avoid licorice
for at least two weeks before the test, because of its
aldosterone-like effect. Strenuous exerciseand stress
can increase aldosterone levels as well. Because the test
is usually performed by a method called radioimmunoas-
say, recently administered radioactive medications will
affect test results.
Since posture and body position affect aldosterone,
hospitalized patients should remain in an upright position
(at least sitting) for two hours before blood is drawn.
Occasionally blood will be drawn again before the
patient gets out of bed. Nonhospitalized patients should
arrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an upright
position for at least two hours.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal results are laboratory-specific and also vary
with sodium intake, with time of day, source of specimen
(e.g., peripheral vein, adrenal vein, 24-hour urine), age,
sex, and posture.
Reference ranges for blood include:
• supine (lying down): 3-10 ng/dL
• upright (sitting for at least two hours): Female: 5-
30ng/dL; Male: 6-22 ng/dL
Reference ranges for urine: 2-80 mg/24 hr.
Abnormal results
Increased levels of aldosterone are found in Conn’s
disease (aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor), and in
cases of Bartter’s syndrome (a condition in which the
kidneys overexcrete potassium, sodium and chloride,
resulting in low blood levels of potassium and high blood
levels of aldosterone and renin). Among other condi-
tions, elevated levels are also seen in secondary aldos-
teronism, stress, and malignant hypertension.
Decreased levels of aldosterone are found in aldos-
terone deficiency, steroid therapy, high-sodium diets,
certain antihypertensive therapies, and Addison’s dis-
ease(an autoimmune disorder).

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 101  Alemtuzumab
Definition
Alemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the United
States. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-
body that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found on
the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that is
used to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cells
of patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (B-CLL).
Purpose
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat
B-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronic
leukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found on
the surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immune
system. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant B
cells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-
tion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-
body-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that the
immune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.
Alemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for
treatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease to
be classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-
darabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,
this drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-
ments for B-CLL another option. As most patients with
B-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylating
agents and fludarabine have been tried, the experience
with alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with those
stages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% of
patients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% of
these being complete responses.
This antibody has been tested with limited success
in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and
for the preparation of patients with various immune cell
malignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There is
also a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-
body to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.
Description
Alemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using
genetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like all
antibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-
ular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.
For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein found
on the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells as
well as other cells of the immune and male reproductive
systems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-
ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips of
the Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but the	rest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of	the human sequences helps to reduce the immune	response by the patient against the antibody itself, a	problem seen when complete mouse antibodies are used	for cancer therapies. The human sequences also help to	ensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of	the human immune system are properly triggered with	binding of the antibody.
Alemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the
treatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use
alone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-
body to be used in combination with the purine analogs
pentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, a
monoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,
another protein found on the surface of B cells.
Recommended dosage
This antibody should be administered in a gradually
escalating pattern at the start of treatment and any time
administration is interrupted for seven or more days. The
recommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is a
daily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-
hour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the dose
is increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,
it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a
week. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-
choride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-
sion to help reduce side effects.
Additionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-
tive medication before treatment to help minimize the
serious opportunistic infections that can result from this
treatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-
vent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to
decrease infections, although they were not eliminated.
Precautions
Blood studies should be done on a weekly basis
while patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-
ment. Vaccination during the treatment session is not
recommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs
during treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies
like alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the
developing fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-
nancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless
clearly needed.
Side effects
A severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the
possible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2102
Alemtuzumab
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102  Because CD52 is expressed on a patient’s normal B and
T cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal B cells,
the treatment eliminates both normal and cancerous
cells. The treatment also seems to trigger autoimmune
reactions against various other blood cells. This results in
severe reduction of the many circulating blood cells
including red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells
(neutropenia), and clotting cells (thrombopenia). These
conditions are treated with blood transfusions. The great
majority of patients treated exhibit some type of blood
cell depletion.
A second serious side effect of this drug is the preva-
lence of opportunistic infections that occurs during the
treatment. Serious, and sometimes fatal bacterial, viral,
fungal, and protozoan infections have been reported.
Treatments to prevent pneumonia and herpes infections
reduce, but do not eliminate these infections.
The majority of other side effects occur after or dur-
ing the first infusion of the drug. Some common side
effects of this drug include fever and chills, nausea and
vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, skin rash, and
unusual fatigue. This drug can also cause low blood pres-
sure (hypotension).
KEY TERMS
Alkylating agent—A chemical that alters the com-
position of the genetic material of rapidly dividing
cells, such as cancer cells, causing selective cell
death; used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat
B-CLL.
Antibody—A protective protein made by the
immune system in response to an antigen, also
called an immunoglobulin.
Autoimmune—An immune reaction of a patient
against their own cells.
Humanization—Fusing the constant and variable
framework region of one or more human
immunoglobulins with the binding region of an
animal immunoglobulin, done to reduce human
reaction against the fusion antibody.
Monoclonal—Genetically engineered antibodies
specific for one antigen.
Tumor lysis syndrome—A side effect of some
immunotherapies, like monoclonal antibodies,
that lyse the tumor cells, due to the toxicity of
flooding the bloodstream with such a quantity of
cellular contents.
In patients with high tumor burden (a large number
of circulating malignant B cells) this drug can cause a
side effect called tumor lysis syndrome. Thought to be
due to the release of the lysed cells’ contents into the
blood stream, it can cause a misbalance of urea, uric
acid, phosphate, potassium, and calcium in the urine and
blood. Patients at risk for this side effect must keep
hydrated and can be given allopurinol before infusion.
Interactions
There have been no formal drug interaction studies
done for alemtuzumab.

Alexander technique
Definition
The Alexander technique is a somatic method for
improving physical and mental functioning. Excessive
tension, which Frederick Alexander, the originator, rec-
ognized as both physical and mental, restricts movement
and creates pressure in the joints, the spine, the breathing
mechanism, and other organs. The goal of the technique
is to restore freedom and expression to the body and
clear thinking to the mind.
Purpose
Because the Alexander technique helps students
improve overall functioning, both mental and physical, it
offers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his
1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements in
such diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing,
depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness,
resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skill
of playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote a
list of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech-
nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis,
then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth-
ma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which
may lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger-
ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of many
types, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures,
migraines and depressive states.”
Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include
improvements in back pain, chronic pain, postural prob-

and childbirth, help in applying physical therapy and
rehabilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused by
computer use, improvements in the posture and perfor-
mance of school children, and improvements in vocal and
dramatic performance among the benefits offered by the
technique.
Description
Origins
Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in
Tasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake-
spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suffer
from strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-
tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with a
recommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,
his problem persisted.
Alexander realized that his hoarseness began about
an hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it
was something he did in the process of reciting that
caused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical
doctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the
doctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was
doing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try
and find out for himself.
Thus began a decade of self-observation and discov-
ery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in
the act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,
walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his
coordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One of
his most startling discoveries was that in order to change
the way he used his body he had to change the way he
was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way that
he did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-
ed speech or movement. After making this discovery at
the end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a
pioneer in body-mind medicine.
At first, performers and dancers sought guidance
from Alexander to overcome physical complaints and
to improve the expression and spontaneity of their
performances. Soon a great number of people sought
help from his teaching for a variety of physical and
mental disorders.
The Alexander technique is primarily taught one-
on-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or
workshops for special applications of the technique
(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-
vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,
and are taught in a series. The number of lessons varies
according to the severity of the student’s difficulties
with coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-
est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-
tinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 per
hour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, but
discounts are available for participants in some comple-
mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible Spending
Accounts for health care cover Alexander technique
lessons if they are prescribed by a physician.
In lessons teachers guide students through simple
movements (while students are dressed in comfortable
clothing) and use their hands to help students identify
and stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arises
from mental processes as well as physical, so discussions
of personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in the
course of a lesson.
The technique helps students move with ease and
improved coordination. At the beginning of a move-
ment (the lessons are a series of movements), most
people pull back their heads, raise their shoulders
toward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten
their legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension in
their bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse of
the body.
At any point in a movement, proper use can be
established. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, the
head will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply
because it is heavier in the front. When the head is out of
balance in the forward direction, it sets off a series of
stretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It is
skillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity in
the feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathing
mechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons in
the technique aim to develop.
Alexander found that optimal functioning of the
body was very hard to maintain, even for the short period
of time it took to complete a single movement. People,
especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-
ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles is
common. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-
visions or video monitors, too much sitting or driving
and too little walking, or by tension associated with past
traumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after a
whiplashinjury or favoring a broken or sprained leg
long after it has healed are examples of habitual tension
caused by injury.
The first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-
nique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness
of this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in
the neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibit
the tension. If the student prepares to sit down, for
example, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.
If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit and
instead to free his neck and allow less constriction in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2104
Alexander technique
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104  his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitual
response to sitting.
By leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur-
al free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, not
held in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release,
the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen,
a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-
dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity and
become skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.
Precautions
Side effects
The focus of the Alexander technique is educational.
Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide students
in movement. Therefore, both contraindications and
potential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-
mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-
ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the case
of errors in teaching, is unlikely.
As students’ sensory awareness develops in the
course of Alexander lessons, they become more acutely
aware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn to
release excessive tension in their muscles and to sustain
this release in daily activity, they may experience tight-
ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused
by the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened and
released muscles and the expanded range of movement
in the joints.
Occasionally students may get light-headed during a
lesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-
latory or respiratory functioning.
Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures
often indicate suppression of emotion. As muscles
release during or after an Alexander lesson, students may
experience strong surges of emotion or sudden changes
in mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface,
bringing to consciousness past injury or trauma. This can
cause extreme anxiety, and referrals may be made by the
teacher for counseling.
Research and general acceptance
Alexander became well known among the intellectu-
al, artistic, and medical communities in London, Eng-
land, during the first half of the twentieth century.
Among Alexander’s supporters were John Dewey,
Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw, and renowned scientists
Raymond Dart, G.E. Coghill, Charles Sherrington, and
Nikolaas Tinbergen.
Researchers continue to study the effects and appli-
cations of the technique in the fields of education, pre-

Alkaline phosphatase test
Definition
Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found through-
out the body. Like all enzymes, it is needed, in small
amounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it
is present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liver
disease or a tumor.
Purpose
Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned
with the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,
and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline
phosphate and other substances is continually drained
away through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bile
duct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.
Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually
escapes into the bloodstream.
The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by
the cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.
Its origin differs from that of other enzymes called
aminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of an
obstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliary
drainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be the
first and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the other
hand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-
cytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,
these enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the type
of liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.
Growing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-
dition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphatase
levels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as a	childhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;	or the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer,
Paget’s disease, or rickets.
During pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made by
the placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.
This is normal. Some tumors, however, start production
of the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by the
placenta. These tumors are called germ cell tumors and
include testicular cancerand certain brain tumors.
Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increased
in a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as
ulcerative colitis.
Description
Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining the
person’s serum with specific substances with which alka-
line phosphatase is known to react. The end product of
this reaction is measured; and from that measurement,
the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serum
is determined.
Each tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—
produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. These
variations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-
line phosphatase is measured as the total amount or the
amount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-
zymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and
other processes in the laboratory. Methods to measure
them separately are based on these differences.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.
Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a
healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper
arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts
a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood
through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of
the sample takes only a few minutes.
A person being tested for alkaline phosphatase
shouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, for
eight to ten hours before the test. Some people release
alkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the blood-
stream after eating. This will temporarily increase the
result of the test.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site
or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the

Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary by age and by sex. They also
vary based on the laboratory and the method used.
Abnormal results
Bone and liver disease increase alkaline phosphatase
more than any other disease, up to five times the normal
level. Irritable bowel disease, germ cell tumors, and
infections involving the liver, such as viral hepatitis and
infectious mononucleosis, increase the enzyme also, but
to a lesser degree. Healing bones, pregnancy, and normal
growth in children also increase levels.

Allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis
Definition
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or ABPA,
is one of four major types of infections in humans caused
by Aspergillusfungi. ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction
that occurs in asthmapatients who are allergic to this
specific fungus.
Description
ABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of
Aspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes
grouped together with other lung disorders characterized
by eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain type
of white blood cell in the blood—under the heading of
eosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also called
hypersensitivity lung diseases.
ABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the
United States, although the reasons for the increase are not
clear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-
ics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.
Causes and symptoms
ABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-
taining Aspergillusspores. These spores are found
worldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,
forests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.
They are also found on wet paint, construction materials,
and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial
infection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-
pital. When Aspergillusspores reach the bronchi, which
are the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,
the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the
patient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes or
coughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-grade
feverand lose their appetites.
Complications
Patients with ABPA sometimes coughup large
amounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis.
They may also develop a serious long-term form of
bronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the
lungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	107
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107  caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and
marked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage to,
the bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-
plication of cystic fibrosis.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of
the patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputum
tests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor will
be concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-
ening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other
lung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-
nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:
• a history of asthma.
• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a
chest x ray.
• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or
destruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).
• skin reaction to Aspergillusantigen.
• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.
•Aspergillusprecipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-
itins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form a
solid that separates from the rest of the solution in the
test tube.
• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a
class of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergic
reactions to foreign particles.
Other criteria that may be used to support the diag-
nosis include the presence of Aspergillusin samples of
the patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brown
mucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillusantigen.
Laboratory tests
The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this
information include a complete blood count(CBC), a
sputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, and
a skin test for the Aspergillusantigen. In the skin test, a
small amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer
of skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches
below the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgE
antibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what is
called a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-
utes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized by
the eruption of a reddened,itchingspot on the skin.
Some patients with ABPA will develop the so-called
late reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,
swollen area develops about six to eight hours after the
initial reaction.
Aspergilluscan sometimes be seen under a micro-
scope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-
nosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-
tured in the laboratory. Aspergillusis easy to culture, and
can be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-
Schiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)
preparations.
Diagnostic imaging
Chest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the
presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs of
bronchiectasis.
Treatment
ABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-
corten) or other corticosteroidstaken by mouth, and
with bronchodilators.
Antifungal drugs are notused to treat ABPA because
it is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather
than by direct infection of tissue.
Follow-up care
Patients with ABPA should be given periodic
checkups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A
spirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’s
lung capacity.
Prognosis
Most patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-
teroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-
ual improvement over time. The best indicator of a good
prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.
Patients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-
op severe airway obstruction.
Prevention
ABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillusis a
common fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputum
of most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-
tect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-
post piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet or
rotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites or
newly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-
tioners cleaned regularly. Some patients may be helped
by air filtration systems for their bedrooms or offices.

Allergic purpura
Definition
Allergic purpura (AP) is an allergic reaction of
unknown origin causing red patches on the skin and other
symptoms. AP is also called Henoch-Schonlein purpura,
named after the two doctors who first described it.
Description
“Purpura” is a bleeding disorder that occurs when
capillaries rupture, allowing small amounts of blood to
accumulate in the surrounding tissues. In AP, this occurs
because the capillaries are blocked by protein complexes

Glomeruli—Knots of capillaries in the kidneys
responsible for filtering the blood (singular,
glomerulus).
formed during an abnormal immune reaction. The skin is
the most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-
testinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.
AP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-
ed States each year. Most cases are children between the
ages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often than
girls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
AP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-
cial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are
designed to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.
In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can
become too large to remain suspended in the blood-
stream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and
become lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-
illary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.
The source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.
Antigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-
tion. More than 75% of patients report having had an
infection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-
trointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.
Other complex molecules can act as antigens as well,
including drugs such as antibioticsor vaccines. Other-
wise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-
tion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may
cause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,
and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include
those for typhoid,measles,cholera, and yellow fever.
Symptoms
The onset of AP may be preceded by a headache,
fever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an
itchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, and
may be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-
er, resembling a bruise. Rashesbecome purple and then
rust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-
eral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,
abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on the
body may also occur, especially in younger children.
Joint painand swelling is common, especially in
the knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almost
all patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).
About half of all patients show blood in the urine, low
urine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.
Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstruction
of the capillaries in the filtering structures called
glomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of all
patients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-
tein in the urine.
Less common symptoms include prolonged head-
ache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-
ment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack
(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas
(pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their
development, a careful medical history, and blood and
urine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans(CT)
may be performed to assess complications in the bowel
or other internal organs.
Treatment
Most cases of AP resolve completely without treat-
ment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because of
the possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin pain
relievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids(like
prednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-
ists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requires
monitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.
Patients with severe kidney complications may
require a kidney biopsyso that tissue can be analyzed.
Even after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels of
blood or protein in the urine may persist for months and
require regular monitoring. Hypertensionor kidney fail-
ure may develop months or even years after the acute
phase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis or
transplantation.
Plasmapheresis, which removes antibodies from
the blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.
Prognosis
Most people who develop AP become better on their
own after several weeks. About half of all patients have
at least one recurrence. Cases that do not have kidney
complications usually have the best prognosis.

Allergic rhinitis
Definition
Allergic rhinitis, more commonly referred to as hay
fever, is an inflammation of the nasal passages caused by
allergic reaction to airborne substances.
Description
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic
condition and one of the most common of all minor
afflictions. It affects between 10-20% of all people in
the United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-
tor visits. Antihistaminesand other drugs used to treat
allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both
prescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.
There are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and
perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,
and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at their
highest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-
nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause of
symptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all year
and is usually caused by home or workplace airborne
pollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.
Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-
doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after
spending time indoors.
Both types of allergiescan develop at any age,
although onset in childhood through early adulthood is
most common. Although allergy to a particular substance
is not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run in
the family.” While allergies can improve on their own
over time, they can also become worse over time.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Allergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-
mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-
ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producing
specific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable of	binding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-	eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen	sets off a series of reactions designed to protect the body	from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions	is triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is the	condition known as allergy, and the offending substance	is called an allergen.
Like all allergic reactions, AR involves a special
set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.
Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages
and eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called
immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,
mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,
called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-
gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spill
out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including
blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,
histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,
through special proteins called histamine receptors.
Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-
sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leading
to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased redness
characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.
Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, causing the
itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-
gic rhinitis.
The number of possible airborne allergens is enor-
mous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grass
and tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in large
amounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,
like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a sticky
pollen which is less likely to become airborne. Different
plants release their pollen at different times of the year,
so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,
summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke a
response. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected in
the pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-
ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after a
good rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higher
on warm, dry, windy days.
Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. A
few types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble for
people include the following:
• ragweed
• sagebrush
• lamb’s-quarters
• plantain
• pigweed
• dock/sorrel

Allergic rhinitis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 111  • tumbleweed
Perennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a
complicated mixture of airborne particles, many of
which are potent allergens. House dust contains some or
all of the following:
• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-
bers of microscopic insects called house mites. These
harmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by
the house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-
ly become airborne.
• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,
and dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred from
pet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergy
in many sensitive people.
• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout the
house, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, air
conditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,
mattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and other
molds release airborne spores which circulate through-
out the house.
Other potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis
include the following:
• cigarette smoke
• perfume
• cosmetics
• cleansers
• copier chemicals
• industrial chemicals
• construction material gases
Symptoms
Inflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major
symptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching, sneezing,
runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling can
constrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner ear
to the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-
ping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the back
of the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, can
also lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually also
causes redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigueand
headacheare also common.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can
often be done without a medical specialist. When symp-
toms appear in spring or summer and disappear with the
onset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainly
the culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,
can usually be ruled out by a physical examinationand
a nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on a
swab for examination.
Allergy tests, including skin testing and provoca-
tion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, but
may not be done unless a single source is suspected and
subsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involves
placing a small amount of liquid containing a specific
allergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,
or injecting it into the skin surface to observe whether
redness and swelling occurs. Provocation testing
involves challenging an individual with either a small
amount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a
response is elicited.
Perennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-
ful questioning about the timing of exposure and the
onset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identified
through allergy skin testing.

Avoidance of the allergens is the best treatment, but
this is often not possible. When it is not possible to avoid
one or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-
ical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.
Drugs
ANTIHISTAMINES.Antihistamines block the hista-
mine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of
histamine release by mast cells. They may be used after
symptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-
tive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. A
wide variety of antihistamines are available.
Older antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a
major side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-
lowing:
• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)
• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)
• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)
• clemastine (Tavist and generics).
Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness
are available by prescription and include the following:
• astemizole (Hismanal)
• loratidine (Claritin)
• fexofenadine (Allegra)
• azelastin HCl (Astelin).
Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart
arrhythmiaswhen taken with the antibiotic ery-
thromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-
conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more
than the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause
arrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-
drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from
the market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of
this potential and because of the availability of an equal-
ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.
DECONGESTANTS.Decongestantsconstrict blood
vessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal sprays
are available that can be applied directly to the nasal lining
and oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestants
are stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and blood
pressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-
tants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-
ness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passages
become more severely swollen than before treatment.
TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos-
teroidsreduce mucous membrane inflammation and are
available by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse
as the season progresses because the immune system
becomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-
duce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids
are especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-
zation because they work more slowly and last longer
than most other medication types. As a result, they are
best started before allergy season begins. Side effects are
usually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,
and unpleasant taste sensations.
MAST CELL STABILIZERS.Cromolyn sodium prevents
the release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing
release of histamine and the other chemicals contained in
them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-
al weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can be
used for perennial AR as well.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or
allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the
body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic
reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing
to determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections
involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of
allergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic
boosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to
achieve and are not seen at all in about one in five
patients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored
closely following each shot because of the small risk of
anaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty
breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AR often focus on modu-
lation of the body’s immune response, and frequently
center around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chinese
herbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, as
can both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment.
Vitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize the
mucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west-
ern herbal remedies including eyebright (Euphrasia
officinalis) and nettle (Urtica dioica) may be helpful.
Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi-
nating AR symptoms.
Prognosis
Most people with AR can achieve adequate relief
with a combination of preventive strategies and treat-
ment. While allergies may improve over time, they may
also get worse or expand to include new allergens. Early
treatment can help prevent an increased sensitization to
other allergens.

• stay indoors with windows closed during the morning
hours, when pollen levels are highest
• keep car windows up while driving
• use a surgical face mask when outside
• avoid uncut fields
• learn which trees are producing pollen in which sea-

Allergies
Definition
Allergies are abnormal reactions of the immune sys-
tem that occur in response to otherwise harmless sub-
stances.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2114
Allergies
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 114  Description
Allergies are among the most common of medical
disorders. It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or
more than one in every five people, suffer from some
form of allergy, with similar proportions throughout
much of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largest
reason for school absence and is a major source of lost
productivity in the workplace.
An allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,
the immune system responds to foreign microorganisms
or particles by producing specific proteins called anti-
bodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-
tifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.
This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a
series of chemical reactions designed to protect the
body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of
reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances
such as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When this
occurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-
stance (an allergen.)
Mast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-
tions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,
called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-
gens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets
called granules. Granules contain a variety of potent
chemicals, including histamine.
Immunologists separate allergic reactions into two
main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which
are predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur within
minutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-
sitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of white
blood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.
Inhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-
ate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-
bodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-
tents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-
ing blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to the
surfaces of these other cells through special proteins
called histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with
receptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,
leading to the fluid collection, swelling and increased
redness. Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, mak-
ing tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms last
from one to several hours following contact.
In the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-
sitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-
shot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointesti-
nal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation of
the intestinal lining, which causes the cramping and
diarrheatypical of food allergy. Allergens that enter the
circulation may cause hives, angioedema,anaphylaxis,
or atopic dermatitis.
Allergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-
sensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,
setting in motion a more prolonged immune response.
This type of allergic response may develop over several
days following contact with the allergen, and symptoms
may persist for a week or more.
Causes and symptoms
Allergens enter the body through four main routes:
the airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the
circulatory system.
• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,
and itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever(allergic rhini-
tis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the
lungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes,
causing conjunctivitis(pink eye). Exposure to cock-
roach allergans have been associated with the devel-
opment of asthma. Airborne allergans from household
pets are another common source of environmental
exposure.
• Allergens in food can cause itchingand swelling of the
lips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbed
into the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)
or more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-
inflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,
organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergens
may cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threatening
condition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-
tion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods such
cow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and
soybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-
bles may also occur.
• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-
ing, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis.
Skin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-
duced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.
This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis.
Dermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such
as from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causing
nonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,
and chemical agents).
• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stingsor
drug administration, can introduce allergens directly
into the circulation, where they may cause system-wide
responses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the local
ones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.
People with allergies are not equally sensitive to
all allergens. Some may have severe allergic rhinitis
but no food allergies, for instance, or be extremely sen-

Allergies
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 115  sitive to nuts but not to any other food. Allergies may
get worse over time. For example, childhood ragweed
allergy may progress to year-round dust and pollen
allergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergic
sensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-
pears in almost all people. More commonly, what
seems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reduced
exposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for the
same level of symptoms.
While allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,
the likelihood of developing some type of allergy seems
to be, at least for many people. If neither parent has
allergies, the chances of a child developing allergy is
approximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is
30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.One
source of this genetic predisposition is in the ability to
produce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.
Those who produce more IgE will develop a stronger
allergic sensitivity.
COMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne
allergens are the following:
• plant pollens
• animal fur and dander
• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures
found in all houses)
• house dust
• mold spores
• cigarette smoke
• solvents
• cleaners
Common food allergens include the following:
• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts
• fish, mollusks, and shellfish
• eggs
• wheat
• milk
• food additives and preservatives
The following types of drugs commonly cause aller-
gic reactions:
• penicillin or other antibiotics
• flu vaccines
• tetanus toxoid vaccine
• gamma globulin
Common causes of contact dermatitis include the
following:
• poison ivy, oak, and sumac
• nickel or nickel alloys
• latex
Insects and other arthropods whose bites or stings
typically cause allergy include the following:
• bees, wasps, and hornets
• mosquitoes
• fleas
• scabies
Symptoms depend on the specific type of allergic
reaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,
runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat due
to post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane
covering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,
irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-
es wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symp-
toms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-
tive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-
temically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinal
symptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,
tongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; and
gas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,
weepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. It
sometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such as
a glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,
wrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-
lobes by wearing earrings.
Whole body or systemic reactions may occur from
any type of allergen, but are more common following
ingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions
include the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called
hives that characteristically blanch with pressure and
resolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more
extensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid
collection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually
occurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the
head,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway
constriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue
swelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,
loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include,dizzi-
ness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-
ing. The symptoms may begin within five minutes after
exposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later.
Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the blood
release mediators that give rise to the clinical symptoms
of this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Common-
ly, this is associated with allergies to medications, foods,
and insect venoms. In some individuals, anaphylaxis can
occur with exercise, plasma exchange, hemodialysis,
reaction to insulin, radocontrast media used in certain

tion of local anesthetics.
Diagnosis
Allergies can often be diagnosed by a careful med-
ical history, matching the onset of symptoms to the
exposure to possible allergens. Allergy is suspected if
the symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergic
reaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure to
the suspected allergan. Allergy testscan be used to
identify potential allergens, but these must be supported
by eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-
cal history.
Skin tests
Skin tests are performed by administering a tiny
dose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,
puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is applied
to the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,
forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-
gen may produce a classic immune wheal and flare
response (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressible
area surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually begin
with prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to
small amounts of allergen to observe the response. A
positive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-
gen is at levels normally encountered in food or in the
airways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximately
fifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin tests
involved injection of the allergan into the dermis of the
skin. These tests are more sensitive and are used for
allergies associated with risk of death, such as allergies
to antibiotics.
Allergen-Specific IgE Measurement
Tests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies
generally follow a basic method. The allergen is bound
to a solid support, either in the form of a cellulose
sponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’s
serum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubated
with the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodies
are present, they will bind to the solid phase and be
retained there when the rest of the serum is washed
away. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is added
and will bind to any IgE on the solid phase. The excess
is washed away and the levels of IgE are determined.
The commonly used RAST test (radio allergo sorbent

Allergies
Allergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by
exposure to household dust, animal fur,
or pollen. The foreign substance that
triggers an allergic reaction is called
an allergen.
The presence of an allergen causes the
body's lymphocytes to begin producing
IgE antibodies. The lymphocytes of an 
allergy sufferer produce an unusually
large amount of IgE.

cells, which contain histamine.

Updated methods now incorporate the use of enyzme-
labeled antibodies in ELISA assays (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays).
Total Serum IgE
The total level of IgE in the serum is commonly
measured with a two-site immunometric assay. Some
research indicates that there is a higher level of total
serum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-
ple. However, this may not always be the case as there is
considerable overlap between the two groups.This test is
useful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitisand
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other conditions that
are not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-
els such as smoking,AIDS, infection with parasites,
and IgE myeloma.
Provocation tests
These tests involve the administration of allergen to
ellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-
monly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen
directly through the route normally involved. Delayed
allergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar
methods by application of a skin patch with allergen to
induce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-
tion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen for
two weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measured
amount of the test substance administered as an opaque
capsule along with a placebo control. Provocation tests
are not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to the
patient’s medical history.
Future diagnostic methods
As of 2000, attempts have been made for direct
measurement of immune mediators such as histamine,
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast cell
tryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-
trodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.
This test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-
tion in the United States, though not approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. An electric potential is
applied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-
trical resistance observed for changes. This method has
not been verified.
Treatment
Avoiding allergens is the first line of defense to
reduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful to
avoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,
perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, air
fresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorly
vented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-
places has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dust
mite control is particularly important in the bedroom
areas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattress
and pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hot
water,and removal of items that collect dust such as
stuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducing
indoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduce
indoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-
tems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such as
the bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals should
avoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,
urine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,
restriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of the
home may be beneficial.
Complete environmental control is often difficult to
accomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may
become necessary. A large number of prescription and
over-the-counter drugs are available for treatment of
immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of these
work by decreasing the ability of histamine to provoke
symptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-
mine by stimulating other systems or reducing immune
responses in general.
Antihistamines
Antihistaminesblock the histamine receptors on
nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine released
by mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,
though they may be even more effective when used pre-
ventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines are
help reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A wide
variety of antihistamines are available.
Older, first generation antihistamines often produce
drowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry mouth,
tachycardia, blurred vision,constipation, and lower the
threshold for seizures. These medicatios also have simi-
lar effects to a alcohol and care should be taken when
operating motor vehicles, as individuals may not be
aware that they are impared. Such antihistamines include
the following:
• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)
• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)
• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)
• clemastine (Tavist and generics)
Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness
or pass the blood-brain barrier are available by prescrip-
tion and include the following:
• loratidine (Claritin)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2118
Allergies
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 118  • fexofenadine (Allegra)
Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart
arrhythmiaswhen taken with the antibiotic ery-
thromycin,the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-
conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more
than the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause
arrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-
drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from
the market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of
this potential and because of the availability of an equal-
ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.
Decongestants
Decongestantsconstrict blood vessels to the
mucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. This
decreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngeal
and sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal sprays
are available that can be applied directly to the nasal lin-
ing and oral systemicpreparations are available. Decon-
gestants are stimulants and may cause increased heart
rate and blood pressure, headaches,insomnia,agitation,
and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of topical
decongestants for longer than several days can cause
loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in which
nasal passages become more severely swollen than
before treatment.
Topical corticosteroids
Topical corticosteroidsreduce mucous membrane
inflammationas by decreasing the amount of fluid
moved from the vascular spaces into the tissues. These
medications reduce the recruitment of inflammatory
cells as well as the synthesis of cytokines. They are
available by prescription. Allergies tend to become
worse as the season progresses because the immune sys-
tem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and can
produce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticos-
teroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonal
sensitization because they work more slowly and last
longer than most other medication types. As a result,
they are best started before allergy season begins. Side
effects are usually mild, but may include headaches,
nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.
Bronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)
Because allergic reactions involving the lungs cause
the airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in asthma,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	119
Allergies
In a future exposure to the same substance,
the antibodies on the mast cells bind to the
allergens, and the cells release their histamine.
Histamine travels to receptor sites in the nasal	passages. When histamine molecules enter the	sites they trigger dilation of the blood vessels,	swelling, irritation, and increased production	of mucus.
Antihistamine drugs block histamine molecules
from entering receptor sites, thus preventing or
reducing swelling, congestion and irritation.
Antihistamines
SECOND EXPOSURE

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 119  bronchodilators, which cause the smooth muscle lining
the airways to open or dilate, can be very effective.
When inahlers are used, it is important that the patient
be educated in the proper use of these medications.The
inhaler should be shaken, and the patient should breathe
out to expel air from the lungs. The inhaler should be
place at least two fingerbreadths in front of the mouth.
The medication should be aimed at the back of the
throat, and the inhaler activated while breathing in quite
slowly 3-4 seconds. The breath should be held for at
least ten seconds, and then expelled. At least thirty to
sixty seconds should pass before the inhaler is used
again. Care should be taken to properly wash out the
mouth and brush the teeth following use, as residual
medication remains in this area with only a small
amount actually reaching the lungs. Some bronchodila-
tors used to treat acute asthma attacks include adrena-
line, albuterol, or other “adrenoceptor stimulants,” most
often administered as aerosols. Futicasone (Flovent) is
another commonly prescribed inhaler. Some bron-
chodilators used to treat acute asthma attacks include

begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy sea-
son. It can also be used for year round allergy preven-
tion. Cromolyn sodium is available as a nasal spray for

LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. These medications are
useful for individuals with aspirinsensitivity,sinusitis,
polposis, urticaria. Examples include zafirlukast (Acco-
late),montelukast (Singulair), and zileuton (Zyflo).
When zileuton is used, care must be taken to measure
liver enzymes.
Immunotherapy
In this form of therapy, allergen is injected into the
skin in increasing doses over a specific period of time.
This may be helpful for patients who do not respond to
medications or avoidance of allergens in the environ-
ment. This type of therapy may reduce the need for med-
ications.
Treatment of contact dermatitis
An individual suffering from contact dermatitis
should initially take steps to avoid possible wources of
exposure to the offending agent. Calamine lotion applied
to affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat, as can
cold water compresses. Side effects of topical agents
may include over-drying of the skin.In the case of acute
contact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapy
may be appropriate. Moderately strong coricosteroids
can also be applied as a wrap for twenty-four hours.
Health care workers are especially at risk for hand erup-
tions due to glove use.
Treatment of anaphylaxis
The emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated
with injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.
People who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food or
insect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containing
adrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other medications
may be given to aid the action of the epi-pen. Prompt
injection can prevent a more serious reaction from
developing. Paticular care should be taken to assess the
affected individual’s airway status, and he or she should
be placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter-
mined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or an
injection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximal
to the area where the agent penetrated the skin. This
should then be released at intervals of ten minutes at a
time, for one to two minutes duration. If the individual
does not respond to such interventions, then emergency
treatment is appropriate.
Alternative treatment
Any alternative treatment for allergies begins with
finding the cause and then helping the patient to avoid
or eliminate the allergen, although this is not always
possible. As with any alternative therapy, a physician
should be consulted before initiating a new form of
treatment. Education on the use of alternative agents is
critical, as they are still “drugs” even though they are
derived from natural sources.Various categories of
alternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-
ment, including:
• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-
peridin act as natural anithistamines.
• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies
Ferrum phosphoricumand Kali muriaticum(used alter-
nately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteine
are believed to have decongestant effects.
• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and
hesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.
• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea(Echinaceaspp.)
and astragalus or milk-vetch root (Astragalus mem-
branaceus) may possibly help to strengthen the
immune system.
• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra (Ephedra
sinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese
medicine), khellin (Ammi visnaga) and cramp bark
(Viburnum opulus) are believed to help open the airways.
Treatment of contact dermatitis
A variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-
ly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-
ment of contact dermatitis. A poultice (crushed herbs
applied directly to the affected area) made of jewelweed
(Impatiensspp.) or chickweed (Stellaria media) may
soothe the skin. A cream or wash containing calendula
(Calendula officinalis), a natural antiseptic and anti-
inflammatory agent, may help heal the rash when
applied topically. Homeopathic treatment may include
such remedies as Rhus toxicodendron,Apis mellifica,or
Anacardiumtaken internally. A qualified homeopathic
practitioner should be consulted to match the symptoms
with the correct remedy. Care should be taken with any
agent taken internally.
Prognosis
Allergies can improve over time, although they often
worsen. While anaphylaxis and severe asthma are life-

Allergies

recognize and avoid allergy-provoking situations allows
most people with allergies to lead normal lives.
Prevention
Avoiding allergens is the best means of limiting
allergic reactions. For food allergies, there is no effective
treatment except avoidance. By determining the allergens
that are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoid
allergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergens
such as poison ivy or latex. Airborne allergens are more
difficult to avoid, although keeping dust and animal dan-
der from collecting in the house may limit exposure.
Cromolyn sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation,
thereby limiting the allergic response.
Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or
allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in
the body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause
allergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by aller-
gy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi-
ble. Injections involve very small but gradually
increasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks or
months, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may take
up to several years to achieve and are not seen at all in
about one in five patients. Individuals receiving all
shots will be monitored closely following each shot
because of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition
that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop
in blood pressure.
Other drugs, including steroids, are used to prevent
asthma attacks and in the long-term management of asthma.

Allergy tests
Definition
Allergy tests indicate a person’s allergic sensitivity
to commonly encountered environmental substances.
Purpose
Allergy is a reaction of the immune system. Nor-
mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-
ganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producing
specific proteins called antibodies that are capable of
binding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the
foreign organisms. This reaction between antibody and
antigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protect
the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of
reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.
This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-
ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled
allergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tiny
house mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,
and milk.
Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells in
the immune system known as mast cells. Mast cells
serve as guards in the tissues where the body meets the
outside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of the
eyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory
and digestive systems. Mast cells display a special type
of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on
their surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicals
in small packets, called granules. When the antibodies
encounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,
which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,
including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these
chemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these
other cells, through special proteins called histamine
receptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on
blood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,
leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased
redness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated
eyes. Histamine also stimulates painreceptors, causing
the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in
allergic rhinitis.
The particular allergens to which a person is sensi-
tive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergy
tests may be performed on the skin or using blood serum
in a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens are
placed on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-
allergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s blood
serum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-
mine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo-
cation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2122
Allergy tests
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 122  gen, either through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reac-
tions from any of these tests may be used to narrow the
candidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.
Identification of the allergenic substance may allow
the patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergic
reactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done in
those with asthmathat is difficult to manage, eczema, or
skin rashesto determine if an allergy is causing the con-
dition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be done
before allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of
more extensive exposure.
Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test.
There are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In
percutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are
placed on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a
needle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and
become exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which
the skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less
often. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting
allergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,
swollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-
stance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity is
seen for allergens regardless of whether they usually
affect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-
gens cause skin reactions equally well.
The range of allergens used for testing is chosen to
reflect possible sources in the environment and may
include the following:
• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and
weeds
• mold and fungus spores
• house dust
• house mites
• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva
• food extracts
• antibiotics
• insect venoms
Radio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory
test performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk
skin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-
vent it.
Provocation testing is done to positively identify
suspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-
fied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested in
increasing concentrations to determine if it will provoke
a response. Food testing is much more tedious than
inhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-
tive system may take a day or more.
Precautions
While allergy tests are quite safe for most people,
the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxisdoes
exist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition
that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in
blood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-
laxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin tests
should never include a substance known to cause ana-
phylaxis in the person being tested.
Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.
Therefore, treatment medications should be available fol-
lowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.
Description
In prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested
is placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.
A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen
drops, including a drop of saline solution that should not
provoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-
mine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A
small needle is inserted through the drop, and used to
prick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.
The sites are examined over the next twenty minutes for
evidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positive
reaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-
tions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.
Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are
made for each allergen tested. Observations are made
over the next twenty minutes.
In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in
the laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum is
separated from the blood cells. The serum is then
exposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a per-
son has antibodies to a particular allergen, those antibod-

Allergen—A substance that provokes an allergic
response.
Anaphylaxis—Increased sensitivity caused by pre-
vious exposure to an allergen that can result in
blood vessel dilation (swelling) and smooth mus-
cle contraction. Anaphylaxis can result in sharp
blood pressure drops and difficulty breathing.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Antigen—A foreign protein to which the body
reacts by making antibodies.
Histamine—A chemical released by mast cells
that activates pain receptors and causes cells to
become leaky.
Mast cells—A type of immune system cell that is
found in the lining of the nasal passages and eye-
lids, displays a type of antibody called immuno-
globulin type E (IgE) on its cell surface, and partici-
pates in the allergic response by releasing hista-
mine from intracellular granules.
ies will bind to the solid medium and remain behind after
a rinse. Location of allergen-antibody combinations is
done by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so called
anti-antibodies, that are chemically linked with a
radioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on the
solid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.
Provocation testing may be performed to identify air-
borne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performed
only after a patient’s lung capacity and response to the
medium used to dilute the allergen has been determined.
Once this has been determined, the patient inhales increas-
ingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen, fol-
lowed each time by measurement of the exhalation capaci-
ty. Only one allergen is tested per day. Testing for food
allergiesis usually done by removing the suspect food
from the diet for two weeks, followed by eating a single
portion of the suspect food and follow-up monitoring.
Preparation
Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination of
the skin. The patient should refrain from using anti-aller-
gy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior to
inhalation testing, patients with asthma who can tolerate
it may be asked to stop any asthma medications. Testing
for food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspect
food for at least two weeks before testing.
Aftercare
Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare. A
generalized redness and swelling may occur in the test
area, but it will usually resolve within a day or two.
Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma attacks,
even if the antigen administered in the test initially pro-
duced no response. Severe initial reactions may justify
close professional observation for at least 12 hours after
testing.
Risks
Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in the
injection of the allergen into the circulation, with an
increased risk of adverse reactions. Inhalation tests may
provoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or unsuspect-
ed allergens in any test carries the risk of anaphylaxis.
Because patients are monitored following allergy testing,
an anaphylactic reaction is usually recognized and treat-
ed promptly. Occasionally, a delayed anaphylactic
response can occur that will require immediate care.
Proper patient education regarding how to recognize ana-
phylaxis is vital.
Normal results
Lack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicates
no allergic response. In an inhalation test, the exhalation
capacity should remain unchanged. In a food challenge,
no symptoms should occur.
Abnormal results
Presence of redness or swelling, especially over 5
mm (1/4 inch) in diameter, indicates an allergic response.

patient’s symptoms, however, since he or she may have
no regular exposure to the allergen. In fact, the actual
allergen may not have been included in the test array.
Following allergen inhalation, reduction in exhala-
tion capacity of more than 20%, and for at least 10-20
minutes, indicates a positive reaction to the allergen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours follow-
ing the ingestion of a suspected food allergen indicates a
positive response.

Alopecia
Definition
Alopecia simply means hair loss (baldness).
Description
Hair loss occurs for a great many reasons—from
pulling it out to having it killed off by cancer chemo-
therapy. Some causes are considered natural, while oth-
ers signal serious health problems. Some conditions are
confined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughout
the body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-
nents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in the
body.
Oftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp
will result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific cause
is the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-
ness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, or
hair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is the
condition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimes
only the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visibly
diseased as well.
Causes and symptoms
• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-
ered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized by
the distribution of hair loss over the top and front of the
head and by the healthy condition of the scalp.
• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown
cause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.
• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair
loss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s
footand ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.
• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that
causes a person to pull out his/her own hair.
• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer
chemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.
Placing a tourniquet around the skull just above the ears
during the intravenous infusion of the drugs may
reduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugs
from reaching the scalp.
• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-
tively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One example
is thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism(too much thy-
roid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 125  Hypothyroidism(too little thyroid hormone) thickens
both hair and skin.
• Several autoimmune diseases (when protective cells
begin to attack self cells within the body) affect the
skin, notably lupus erythematosus.
Diagnosis
Dermatologists are skilled in diagnosis by sight
alone. For more obscure diseases, they may have to
resort to a skin biopsy, removing a tiny bit of skin using
a local anesthetic so that it can examined under a micro-
scope. Systemic diseases will require a complete evalua-
tion by a physician, including specific tests to identify
and characterize the problem.
Treatment
Successful treatment of underlying causes is most
likely to restore hair growth, be it the completion of
chemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or control
of a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs—minox-
idil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)—promote hair
growth in a significant minority of patients, especially
those with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata.
While both drugs have so far proved to be quite safe
when used for this purpose,minoxidilis a liquid that is
applied to the scalp and finasteride is the first and only
approved treatment in a pill form.
Minoxidil was approved for over-the-counter sales
in 1996. When used continuously for long periods of

time, minoxidil produces satisfactory results in about one
quarter of patients with androgenic alopecia and as many
as half the patients with alopecia areata. There is also an
over-the-counter extra-strength version of minoxidil (5%
concentration) approved for use by men only. The treat-
ment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighter
in color. It is important to note that new hair stops grow-
ing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued.
Over the past few decades there have appeared a
multitude of hair replacement methods performed by
both physicians and non-physicians. They range from
simply weaving someone else’s hair in with the remains
of your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hair
follicles one at a time.
Hair transplantationis completed by taking tiny
plugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs,
from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections are
then implanted with the plugs. Research completed in
2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, and
found that micrografts (one to two hairs transplanted
per follicle) resulted in fewer complications and the
best results
Another surgical procedure used to treat androgenic
alopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin the hair-
less scalp can be removed and the area of bald skin
decreased by closing the space with hair-covered scalp.
Hair-bearing skin can also be folded over an area of bald
skin with a technique called a flap.
Prognosis
The prognosis varies with the cause. It is generally
much easier to lose hair than to regrow it. Even when it
returns, it is often thin and less attractive than the original.

Alpha-fetoprotein test
Definition
The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test that
is performed during pregnancy. This screening test mea-
sures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-
cates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-
ous birth defects. The level of AFP can also be deter-
mined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. This
screening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; it
only indicates the increase of risk for several birth
defects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detect
liver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitor
the progress of cancertreatment.
Purpose
Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the
liver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is
unknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing
AFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.
During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and
some of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enter
the mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-
mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. By
analyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-
otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probability
that the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is very
important that the doctor know precisely how old the
fetus is when the test is performed since the AFP level
changes over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFP
screening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test is	used as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate line	of testing (like amniocentesisor ultrasound) follows,
based on the results.
Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus
has an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the most
common and severe type of disorder associated with
increased AFP. These types of defects include spinal
column defects (spina bifida) and anencephaly (a
severe and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tube
that becomes the brain and spinal cord does not close
correctly during fetal development, AFP may leak
through this abnormal opening and enter the amniotic
fluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels of
AFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If the
screening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-
sound is used to diagnosis the problem.
Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels
above normal include:
• cysts at the end of the spine
• blockage in the esophagus or intestines
• liver disease causing liver cells to die
• defects in the abdominal wall
• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease
• brittle bone disease
Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in
the amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-
oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along than
estimated.
For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may
indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down
syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that
includes mental retardationand a distinctive physical
appearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome
21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates
an abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-
nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP can
also occur when the fetus has died or when the mother
is overweight.
AFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that
analyzes three substances as risk indicators of possible
birth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic
gonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-
sured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the test
results increases.
Although AFP in human blood gradually disappears
after birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear in
liver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.
The AFP test is used to screen people at high risk for
these conditions. After a cancerous tumor is removed, an

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 127  AFP test can monitor the progress of treatment. Contin-
ued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.
Precautions
It is very important that the doctor know precisely
how old the fetus is when the test is performed since the
AFP level considered normal changes over the length of
the pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetus
lead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since an
AFP test is only a screening tool, more specific tests
must follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormal
test result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has a
birth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results
(either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetus
that has a serious condition.
Description
The AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of
pregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on the
inside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam-
ple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis.
Test results are usually available after about one week.
Preparation
There is no specific physical preparation for the AFP
test.
Aftercare
There is no specific aftercare involved with this
screening test.
Risks
The risks associated with drawing blood are mini-
mal, but may include bleeding from the puncture site,
feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn, or
blood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma).
Normal results
Alpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per
milliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability. The
KEY TERMS

which the fetus lives until born.

probability (1:100, for example) translates into the
chance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100 chance,
for example).
When testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP
results are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An AFP
level less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered nor-
mal.
Abnormal results
The doctor will inform the woman of her specific
increased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan-
dard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater than
the standard risk for women who are 35 years old or
older (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended.
Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormal
AFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that has
Down’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk;
appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor-
mal screening result.
In tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level
greater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.

1-adrenergic blockers
Definition
Alpha
1-adrenergic blockers are drugs that work by
blocking the alpha
1-receptors of vascular smooth muscle,
thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines by the
smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and allows
blood to flow more easily.
Purpose
These drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are
used for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure
(hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterized
by an enlarged prostategland.
High blood pressure
High blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and
the arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the
blood vessels to the point of causing stroke,heart fail-
ureor kidney failure. People with high blood pressure
may also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controlling
high blood pressure makes these problems less likely.
Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causing
vasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of the
blood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
This condition particularly affects older men. Over
time, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-
der, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere with
the passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.
Men who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinate
more often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-
ly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-
traction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-
cles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to
flow more freely.
Description
Commonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-
sion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin
(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also used
in the treatment of heart failure. All are available only
with a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dose depends on the patient and
the type of alpha blocker and may change over the course
of treatment. The prescribing physician will gradually
increase the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may need	as much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per day	of doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,	but most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosage	increases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.
Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,
even if the medication does not seem to be working at
first. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improve
because it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.
Patients should avoid missing any doses, and should not
take larger or more frequent doses to make up for
missed doses.
Precautions
Alpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a
greater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness,
lightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting. Activ-
ities such as driving, using machines, or doing anything
else that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking the
first dose should be avoided. Patients should be reminded
to be especially careful not to fall when getting up in the
middle of the night. The same precautions are recom-
mended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has been
stopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety on
the job could be affected by taking alpha blockers should
inform his or her physician, so that the physician can
take this factor into account when increasing dosage.
Dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-
ly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drink
alcohol,exercise, stand for a long time, or are exposed to
hot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-
tions and alcohol consumption should be limited.
Some people may feel drowsy or less alert when
using these drugs. They should accordingly avoid driving
or performing activities that require full attention.
People diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease
may also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They should
inform their physicians about these conditions if alpha
blockers are prescribed. Older people may also be more
sensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted side
effects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness.
It should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure
high blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi-
tion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrink
an enlarged prostate gland. Although they will help
relieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, the
prostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may be
necessary to have prostate surgery.
Alpha blockers may lower blood counts. Patients
may need to have their blood checked regularly while
taking this medicine.

blockers in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should also
be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
The effects of taking alpha blockers during preg-
nancyare not fully understood. Women who are preg-
nant or planning to become pregnant should inform their
physicians. Breastfeeding mothers who need to take
alpha blockers should also talk to their physicians. These
drugs can pass into breast milk and may affect nursing
babies. It may be necessary to stop breastfeeding while
being treated with alpha blockers.

The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsi-
ness, tiredness,headache, nervousness, irritability,
stuffy or runny nose, nausea,painin the arms and legs,
and weakness. These problems usually go away as the
KEY TERMS
Adrenergic—Refers to neurons (nerve cells) that use
catecholamines as neurotransmitters at a synapse.
Adrenergic receptor—There are three families of
adrenergic receptors, alpha
1, alpha
2and beta, and
each family contains three distinct subtypes. Each
of the nine subtypes are coded by separate genes,
and display specific drug specificities and regulato-
ry properties.
Alpha blockers—Medications that bind alpha
adrenergic receptors and decrease the workload of
the heart and lower blood pressure. They are com-
monly used to treat hypertension, peripheral vascu-
lar disease, and hyperplasia.
Arteries—Blood vessels that carry oxygenated
blood away from the heart to the cells, tissues, and
organs of the body.
Catecholamines—Family of neurotransmitters con-
taining dopamine, norepinephrine and epineph-
rine, produced and secreted by cells of the adrenal
medulla in the brain. Catecholamines have excita-
tory effects on smooth muscle cells of the vessels
that supply blood to the skin and mucous mem-
branes and have inhibitory effects on smooth mus-
cle cells located in the wall of the gut, the bronchial
tree of the lungs, and the vessels that supply blood
to skeletal muscle. There are two different main
types of receptors for these neurotransmitters,
called alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. The cat-
echolamines are therefore are also known as adren-
ergic neurotransmitters.
Hyperplasia—The abnormal increase in the num-
ber of normal cells in a given tissue.
Hypertension—Persistently high arterial blood pres-
sure.
Neurotransmitter—Substance released from neu-
rons of the peripheral nervous system that travels
across the synaptic clefts (gaps) of other neurons to
excite or inhibit the target cell.
Palpitation—Rapid, forceful, throbbing, or fluttering
heartbeat.
Receptor—A molecular structure in a cell or on the
surface of a cell that allows binding of a specific
substance that causes a specific physiologic
response.
Synapse—A connection between nerve cells, by
which nervous excitation is transferred from one
cell to the other.
Vasodilation—The increase in the internal diameter
of a blood vessel that results from relaxation of
smooth muscle within the wall of the vessel thus
causing an increase in blood flow.
body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treat-
ment. If they do not subside or if they interfere with nor-
mal activities, the physician should be informed.
If any of the following side effects occur, the pre-
scribing physician should be notified as soon as possible:
• fainting
• shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
• fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat
• swollen feet, ankles, wrists
Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking alpha blockers should
contact his or her physician.
Interactions
Doxazosin (Cardura) is not known to interact with
any other drugs. Terazosin (Hytrin) may interact with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibupro-

as enalapril (Vasotec), and verapamil (Calan,Verelan).
Prazosin (Minipress) may interact with beta adrenergic
blocking agents such as propranolol (Inderal) and others,
and with verapamil (Calan, Isoptin.) When drugs inter-
act, the effects of one or both of the drugs may change or
the risk of side effects may be greater.

Alport syndrome
Definition
A hereditary disease of the kidneys that primarily
affects men, causing blood in the urine,hearing lossand
eye problems. Eventually,kidney dialysisor transplant
may be necessary.
Description
Alport syndrome affects about one in 5,000 Ameri-
cans, striking men more often and severely than women.
There are several varieties of the syndrome, some occur-
ring in childhood and others not causing symptoms until
men reach their 20s or 30s. All varieties of the syndrome
are characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-
gresses to chronic kidney failureand by uremia (the
presence of excessive amounts of urea and other waste
products in the blood).
Causes and symptoms
Alport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect
in one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It is
usually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-
er. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-
tory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be a
spontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.
Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of
Alport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear in
varying combinations include:
• protein in the urine (proteinuria)
• sensorineural hearing loss
• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements
(nystagmus),cataracts, or cornea problems]
• skin problems
• platelet disorders
• abnormal white blood cells
• smooth muscle tumors
KEY TERMS
Albumin—A protein that is important in maintain-
ing blood volume. Low albumin levels is one sign
of Alport syndrome.
Dialysis—A technique of removing waste material
from the blood. It is used with patients whose kid-
neys have stopped functioning and can no longer
cleanse the blood on their own.
Diuretic—A drug that increases the amount of
urine a person produces.
Hematuria—Blood in the urine, Hematuria is a
hallmark of Alport syndrome.
Pulmonary edema—Excess fluid in the air spaces
of the lungs.
Uremia—The presence of excessive amounts of
urea and other waste products in the blood.
Not all patients with Alport syndrome have hearing
problems. In general, those with normal hearing have
less severe cases of Alport syndrome.
Diagnosis
Alport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu-
ation and family history, together with a kidney biopsy
that can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condi-
tion. Urinalysismay reveal blood or protein in the urine.
Blood tests can reveal a low platelet level.
In addition, tests for the Alport gene are now avail-
able. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered by
many types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnose
affected children even before birth, and genetic linkage
tests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn-
drome are also available.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alport
syndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the problems
related to kidney failure, such as the presence of too
many waste products in the blood (uremia).
To control kidney inflammation (nephritis), patients
should:
• restrict fluids
• control high blood pressure
• manage pulmonary edema
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	131
Alport syndrome
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 131  • control high blood levels of potassium
Rarely patients with Alport syndrome may develop
nephrotic syndrome, a group of symptoms including
too much protein in the urine, low albumin levels, and
swelling. To ease these symptoms, patients should:
• drink less
• eat a salt-free diet
• use diuretics
• have albumin transfusions
The treatment for chronic kidney failure is dialysis
or a kidney transplant.
Prognosis
Women with this condition can lead a normal life,
although they may have slight hearing loss. An affected
woman may notice blood in her urine only when under
stressor pregnant.
Men generally have a much more serious problem
with the disease. Most will experience kidney disease in
their 20s or 30s, which may eventually require dialysis or
transplantation, and many develop significant hearing
loss. Men with Alport syndrome often die of complica-
tions by middle age.
Prevention
Alport syndrome is a genetic disease and prevention
efforts are aimed at providing affected individuals and
their families with information concerning the genetic
mechanisms responsible for the disease. Since it is possi-
ble to determine if a woman is a carrier, or if an unborn
child has the condition,genetic counselingcan provide
helpful information and support for the decisions that
affected individuals and their families may have to make.

Altitude sickness
Definition
Altitude sickness is a general term encompassing a
spectrum of disorders that occur at higher altitudes.
Since the severity of symptoms varies with altitude, it is
important to understand the range of the different alti-
tudes that may be involved. High altitude is defined as
height greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitude
is defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet
(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined as
height greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority
of healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when
they reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% of
people ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one day
will develop altitude sickness. Children under six years
and women in the premenstrual part of their cycles may
be more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medical
conditions—even a minor respiratory infection—may
become sick at more moderate altitudes.
Description
There are three major clinical syndromes that fall
under the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain
sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema
(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema(HACE).
These syndromes are not separate, individual syndromes
as much as they are a continuum of severity, all resulting
from a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,
and the other two represent severe, life-threatening forms
of altitude sickness.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2132
Altitude sickness
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132  Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure
of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is a
term applied to gases that is similar to the way the term
concentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,
at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen
drops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, there
is a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for the
individual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-
more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygen
reaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These two
conditions are the major factors that form the basis for all
the medical problems associated with altitude sickness.
As a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural
response is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). This
is the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapid
rate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxia
at higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and it
occurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is a
response that occurs in individuals who travel from lower
to higher altitudes. There are groups of people who have
lived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayan
and Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-
ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhaps
through a genetic ability.
Causes and symptoms
Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of
altitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes higher
greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981
m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia is
associated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-
anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-
firmed. It is important to realize that some individuals
acclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.
As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer from
AMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibility
of otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-
not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from
AMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the second
or third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usually
abates after three to five days if they remain at the same
altitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel to
an even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a few
hours to a few days following ascent, and they include
dizziness,headache,shortness of breath, nausea, vomit-
ing, loss of appetite, and insomnia.
High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-
threatening condition that afflicts a small percentage of
those who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaks
from within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lung
tissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lung
tissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins to

become more and more short of breath. HAPE is known
to afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their level
of physical fitness.
Typically, the individual who suffers from HAPE
ascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-
ly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, a
coughproductive of a large amount of sometimes bloody
sputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-
tance is provided by this point, the patient goes into a
comaand dies within a few hours.
High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and
most severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebral
edema, and its mechanism of development is also poorly
understood. The symptoms often begin with those of
AMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered level
of consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,
loss of coordination,hallucinations, and even seizures.
If no intervention is implemented,deathis the result.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made
from the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-
ing travel to higher altitudes.
Treatment
Mild AMS requires no treatment other than an
aspirinor ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-
ther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because they
may blunt the respiratory response, making it even more
difficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidly
enough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen in
the environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviate
symptoms of mild AMS.
As for HAPE and HACE, the most important course
of action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-
ble. Even a 1,000-2,000 -foot (305–610 m) descent can
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	133
Altitude sickness
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 133  dramatically improve one’s symptoms. If descent is not
possible, oxygen therapy should be started. In addition,
dexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order to
reduce cerebral edema.
Prognosis
The prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate
measures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog-
nosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descent
and the availability of medical intervention. Descent
often leads to improvement of symptoms, however,
recovery times vary among individuals.
Prevention
When individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-
mended that they spend at least one night at an interme-
diate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. In
general, climbers should take at least two days to go
from sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reaching
that point, healthy climbers should generally allow one
day for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one day
of rest should be taken every two or three days. Should
mild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should be
avoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual
should return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicate
that acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken before
ascent as a preventative measure for AMS.
Paying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-
tude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,
so climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-
duce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clear
urine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should be
avoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydrate
snacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods) can
help, especially in the first few days of climbing.

Alzheimer’s disease
Definition
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form
of dementia, a neurologic disease characterized by loss
of mental ability severe enough to interfere with normal
activities of daily living, lasting at least six months, and
not present from birth. AD usually occurs in old age, and
is marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as
remembering, reasoning, and planning.
Description
A person with AD usually has a gradual decline in
mental functions, often beginning with slight memory
loss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain
employment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to
reason and exercisejudgment. Communication ability,
mood, and personality may also be affected. Most people
who have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,
although that interval may be as short as one year or as
long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death
in adults after heart disease,cancer, and stroke.
Between two and four million Americans have AD;
that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by
the middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole
ages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50s
develop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-
nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all people
between ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75
and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more
women than men are affected with AD, but this may be
because women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher
proportion of women in the most affected age groups.
The costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-
erable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in
1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient with
mild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and
$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual direct
and indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the United
States was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.
Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for at
home, while the remainder are cared for in a variety of
health care institutions.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
The cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are
unknown. Some strong leads have been found through
recent research, however, and these have also given some
theoretical support to several new experimental treatments.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2134
Alzheimer’s disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134  At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts of
the brain that control memory, including the hippocam-
pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controls
short-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampus
stop functioning, the short-term memory of the person
fails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.
Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areas
responsible for language and reasoning; this language
skills are lost and the ability to make judgments is
changed. Personality changes occur, which may include
emotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-
ity of these changes increases with the progression of the
disease. Eventually many other areas of the brain become
involved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink and
lose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-
den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.
Autopsyof a person with AD shows that the regions
of the brain affected by the disease become clogged with
two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles
and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted
masses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. In
AD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilize
parts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twisted
and tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.
Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-
amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein called
amyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-
rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spaces
between the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clear
exactly how these structures cause problems, many
researchers believe that their formation is responsible for
the mental changes of AD, presumably by interfering
with the normal communication between neurons in the
brain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of
2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms have
been approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). They act by increasing the level of
chemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-
rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-
tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-
cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks down
acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released by
neurons that is necessary for cognitive function. These
drugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’s
ability to perform normal activities of daily living.
What triggers the formation of plaques and tangles
and the development of AD are unknown. AD likely
results from many interrelated factors, including genetic,
environmental, and others not yet identified. Two types
of AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-
mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, with
no obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described in
terms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring in
people younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those
65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 of
AD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases
of early on-set AD are inherited and are common in some
families. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than the
more common late-on-set type.
All FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have
been identified so far are the early on-set type. As many
as 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by three
genes located on three different chromosomes. Some
families have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-
mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormal
APP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-
senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes the
production of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others
have mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-
ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-
mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymes
that clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be important
in the synaptic connections between brain cells.
There is no evidence that the mutated genes that
cause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, but
genetics does appear to play a role in this more common
form of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-
sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most important
genetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene on
this chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes
for a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.
APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), called
APOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inherits
one APOE from each parent, and therefore can either
have one copy of two different forms, or two copies of
one. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect some
people from AD, as it seems to be associated with a
lower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD does
develop. APOE e3 is the most common version found in
the general population, and only appears to have a neu-
tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increase
the risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritance
of one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to those
without APOE e4, people with one copy are about three
times as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those with
two copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-
ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as much
as 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk of
developing AD and does not cause it, as not everyone
with APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it can
still have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases the
chances of developing AD is not known with certainty.
However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-
amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-
ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involve
interactions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve

2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genome
were identified, where one out of several hundred genes
in each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.
These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to make
a contribution to the risk of developing late-onset AD
that is at least as important as APOE e4.
Other non-genetic factors have also been studied in
relation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brain
may play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-
teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) seems to
reduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of blood
flow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting for
the beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases blood
flow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactive
molecular fragments called free radicals damage cells of
all kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-
plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect against
free radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,
and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.
While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s
disease are still unknown, there are several risk factors
that increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-
ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; older
people develop AD at much higher rates than younger
ones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may be
linked, with small strokes that go undetected clinically
contributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterol
levels may also be important. Scientists have shown that
high blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-
cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate
of plaque deposition. There are also parallels between
AD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders
that cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-
son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.
Numerous epidemiological studies of populations are
also being conducted to learn more about whether and to
what extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, and
ethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For
example, results from one study indicated that rural resi-
dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years of
schooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-
ever, the low educational attainment that was identified as
a risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-
terious socioeconomic or environmental influences in
childhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpreting
epidemiological findings, due to the complexity of the
issues and the large number of variables involved.
Many environmental factors have been suspected of
contributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-
ies have not borne out these links. Among these have
been pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-
mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none
of these factors has been shown to cause AD or increase
its likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links to
other environmental factors.
Symptoms
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-
ally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory
lapses are of course common to everyone, and do not by
themselves signify any change in cognitive function. The
person with AD may begin with only the routine sort of
memory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—but
progress to more profound or disturbing losses, such as
forgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becoming
lost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhood
becomes more likely as the disease progresses. A person
with AD may forget the names of family members, or
forget what was said at the beginning of a sentence by
the time he hears the end.
As AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-
ing inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,
and personality or behavior changes. Some patients have
trouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-
tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-
drome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the same
ideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior known
as perseveration. In the final stages people may have
severe problems with eating, communicating, and con-
trolling their bladder and bowel functions.
The Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten
warning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-
toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:
• memory loss that affects job skills
• difficulty performing familiar tasks
• problems with language
• disorientation of time and place
• poor or decreased judgment
• problems with abstract thinking
• misplacing things
• changes in mood or behavior
• changes in personality
• loss of initiative
Other types of dementia, including some that are
reversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important for
the person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-
fessional who can weigh the possibility that his or her
symptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% of
those originally suspected of having AD turn out to have
some other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2136
Alzheimer’s disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 136  Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and
may require office visits to several different specialists
over several months before a diagnosis can be made.
While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made in
most cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be defini-
tively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brain
for plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi-
cal exam and complete medical history. Except in the
disease’s earliest stages, accurate history from family
members or caregivers is essential. Since there are both
prescription and over-the-counter drugs that can cause
the same mental changes as AD, a careful review of the
patient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.
AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-
ical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-
tia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).
These possibilities must be ruled out as well through
appropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso-
nance imaging(MRI),positron emission tomography
(PET) or single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity
(electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Several
types of oral and written tests are used to aid in the AD
diagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests of
mental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen-
tration. Still, the neurologic examis normal in most
patients in early stages.
One of the most important parts of the diagnostic
process is to evaluate the patient for depression and
delirium, since each of these can be present with AD,
or may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a
decreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ-
ment.) Depression and memory loss are both common
in the elderly, and the combination of the two can often
be mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated with
drugs, although some antidepressants can worsen
dementia if it is present, further complicating both diag-
nosis and treatment.
An early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important
in developing strategies for managing symptoms and for
helping patients and their families planning for the future
and pursuing care options while the patient can still take
part in the decision-making process.
A genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, but
is not used for diagnosis, since possessing even two
copies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. In
addition, access to genetic information could affect the
insurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affect
employment status and legal rights.
Treatment
Alzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there-
fore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD is
good nursing care, providing both physical and emotion-
al support for a person who is gradually able to do less
and less for himself, and whose behavior is becoming
more and more erratic. Modifications of the home to
increase safety and security are often necessary. The
caregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,
and burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becoming
familiar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-
ing the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,
can help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-
cult process of the disease. Regular medical care by a
practitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD is
important so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratory
infections can be diagnosed and treated properly, rather
than being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable decline
seen in AD.
People with AD are also often depressed or anxious,
and may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition, and
general poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable
to some degree. It is important for the person with AD to
eat well and continue to exercise. Professional advice
from a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,
easy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable to
those requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise
(supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overall
health. A calm, structured environment with simple ori-
entation aids (such as calendars and clocks) may reduce
anxietyand increase safety. Other psychiatric symptoms,
such as depression, anxiety,hallucinations(seeing or
hearing things that aren’t there), and delusions(false
beliefs) may be treated with drugs if necessary.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 137  Drugs
As of 2000, only three drugs—tacrine (Cognex),
donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine
(Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its treat-
ment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv-
ing memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod-
erate AD, and even then in less than half of those who take
it. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, but
it may delay the need for nursing home admission. The
most significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzyme
known as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak-
ing tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor their
ALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,
vomiting,diarrhea, abdominal pain,indigestion, and
skin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month in
early 1998, with additional costs for the weekly blood
monitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to be
cost-effective for those who respond to it, since it may
decrease the number of months a patient needs nursing
care. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treat
mild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps
some patients for periods of time ranging from months to
about two years. Donepezil has two advantages over
tacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given once
daily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does not
appear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does not
require weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominal
side effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-
mately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in April
of 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patients
to carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,
decrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-
tation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,
memory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of the
other two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stops
or reverses the progression of AD.
Estrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-
scribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo-
porosis. Several preliminary studies have shown that
women taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and those
who develop AD have a slower progression and less
severe symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear to
have a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.
Preliminary studies have also suggested a reduced
risk for developing AD in older people who regularly use
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-
ing aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-
minophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-
acteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect of
the disease is not yet known.
Antioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect
against oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have
been shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-
sue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to see
whether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.
Another antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to
delay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due to
the specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to an
increase in the overall health of those taking it.
Drugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and
sedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms
(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders)
of AD. Research is being conducted to search for better
treatments, including non-drug approaches for AD
patients.
Nursing care and safety
The person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually
lose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use the
toilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, he
may be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-
son’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency to
wander may make it difficult to leave him unattended for
even a few minutes and make even the home a potentially
dangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibit
inappropriate sexual behaviors.
The nursing care required for a person with AD is
well within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-
ficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant but
unpredictable nature of the demands put on them. In
addition, the personality changes undergone by a person
with AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as a
loved one deteriorates, seeming to become a different
person. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:
some become quite gentle, and spend increasing amounts
of time in dreamlike states.
A loss of good grooming may be one of the early
symptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,
and decreased interest in personal hygiene become more
common. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find these
changes socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with.
The caregiver will usually need to spend increasing
amounts of time for grooming to compensate for the loss
of attention from the patient, although some adjustment
of expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is often
needed as the disease progresses.
Proper nutrition is important for a person with AD,
and may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure the
person is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move-
ment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube may
be placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. A
feeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easy
to care for if the patient is not resistant to its use.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2138
Alzheimer’s disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 138  For many caregivers, incontinence becomes the
most difficult problem to deal with at home, and is a
principal reason for pursuing nursing home care. In the
early stages, limiting fluid intake and increasing the fre-
quency of toileting can help. Careful attention to hygiene
is important to prevent skin irritation and infection from
soiled clothing.
Persons with dementia must deal with six basic safe-
ty concerns: injury from falls, injury from ingesting dan-
gerous substances, leaving the home and getting lost,
injury to self or others from sharp objects, fire or burns,
and the inability to respond rapidly to crisis situations. In
all cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longer
be allowed to drive, because of the increased potential
for accidents and the increased likelihood of wandering
very far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim-
ple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed rails
on the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great-
ly increase safety. Electrical appliances should be
unplugged and put away when not in use, and matches,
lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely out
of reach. The hot water heater temperature may be set
lower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergency
numbers, including the poison control center and the
hospital emergency room, should be posted by the
phone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri-
odically reevaluate the physical safety of the home and
introduce new strategies for continued safety.
Care for the caregiver
Family members or others caring for a person with
AD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, which
becomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementia
caregivers spend significantly more time on caregiving
than do people providing care for those with other types
of illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greater
impact in terms of employment complications, caregiver
strain, mental and physical health problems, time for
leisure and other family members, and family conflict
than do other types of caregiving. It is common for AD
caregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,
and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for
their loved one and for themselves. Depression is an
extremely common consequence of being a full-time
caregiver for a person with AD. Support groups are an
important way to deal with the stressof caregiving.
Becoming a member of an AD caregivers’ support group
can be one of the most important things a family member
does, not only for him or herself, but for the person with
AD as well. The location and contact numbers for AD
caregiver support groups are available from the
Alzheimer’s Association; they may also be available
through a local social service agency, the patient’s physi-
cian, or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the
drugs used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depression
may be an important adjunct to group support.
Outside help, nursing homes, and governmental
assistance
Most families eventually need outside help to relieve
some of the burden of around-the-clock care for a person
with AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer or
paid, may be available through local social service agen-
cies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasingly
common. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respite
care may be available as well.
Providing the total care required by a person with
late-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for a
family, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami-
lies consider nursing home care. This decision is often one
of the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen as
an abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami-
ly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler-
gy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of this
transition. Selecting a nursing home may require a difficult
balancing of cost, services, location, and availability.
Keeping the entire family involved in the decision may
help prevent further stress from developing later on.
Several federal government programs may ease the
cost of caring for a person with AD, including Social
Security Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Securi-
ty Income. Each of these programs may provide some
assistance for care, medication, or other costs, but none
of them will pay for nursing home care indefinitely.
Medicaid is a state-funded program that may provide for
some or all of the cost of nursing home care, although
there are important restrictions. Details of the benefits
and eligibility requirements of these programs are avail-
able through the local Social Security or Medicaid office,
or from local social service agencies.
Private long-term care insurance, special “reverse
mortgages,” viatical insurance, and other financial devices
are other ways of paying for care for those with the appro-
priate financial situations. Further information on these
options may be available through resources listed below.
Alternative treatment
Several substances are currently being tested for
their ability to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease.
These include acetylcarnitine, a supplement that acts on
the cellular energy structures known as mitochondria.
Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo
bilobatree, appears to have antioxidant as well as anti-
inflammatory and anticoagulant properties. Ginkgo
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	139
Alzheimer’s disease
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 139  extract has been used for many years in China and is
widely prescribed in Europe for treatment of circulatory
problems. A 1997 study of patients with dementia
seemed to show that ginkgo extract could improve their
symptoms, though the study was criticized for certain
flaws in its method.Large scale follow-up studies are
being conducted to determine whether Ginkgo extract
can prevent or delay the development of AD. Ginkgo
extract is available in many health food or nutritional
supplement stores. Some alternative practitioners also
advise people with AD to take supplements of phos-
phatidylcholine, vitamin B
12, gotu kola, ginseng, St.
John’s Wort, rosemary, saiko-keishi-to-shakuyaku (A
Japanese herbal mixture), and folic acid.
Prognosis
While Alzheimer’s disease may not be the direct
cause of death, the generally poorer health of a person
with AD increases the risk of life-threatening infection,
including pneumonia. In addition, other diseases com-
mon in old age—cancer, stroke, and heart disease—may
lead to more severe consequences in a person with AD.
On average, people with AD live eight years past their
diagnosis, with a range from one to 20 years.
Prevention
There is currently no sure way to prevent Alzheimer’s
disease, although some of the drug treatments discussed
above may eventually be proven to reduce the risk of
developing the disease. The most likely current candidates
are estrogen, NSAIDs, vitamin E, and ginkgo biloba,
although this list may grow or shrink with further research.
KEY TERMS
Acetylcholine—One of the substances in the body
that helps transmit nerve impulses.
Dementia—Impaired intellectual function that
interferes with normal social and work activities.
Ginkgo—An herb from the Ginkgo bilobatree that
some alternative practitioners recommend for the
prevention and treatment of AD.
Neurofibrillary tangle—Twisted masses of protein
inside nerve cells that develop in the brains of
people with AD.
Senile plaque—Structures composed of parts of
neurons surrounding brain proteins called beta-
amyloid deposits and found in the brains of peo-
ple with AD.
Research on the prevention of AD is focusing on
blocking the production of amyloid in the brain as well
as breaking down beta-amyloid once it is released from
cells but before it has a chance to aggregate into insolu-
ble plaques. There are also promising studies being con-
ducted to develop an AD vaccine, where immune
responses may result in the elimination of the formation
of amyloid plaques.
The Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADCs)
program promotes research, training and education,
technology transfer, and multicenter and cooperative
studies in AD, other dementias, and normal brain aging.
Each ADC enrolls and performs studies on AD patients
and healthy older people. Persons can participate in
research protocols and clinical drug trials at these cen-
ters. Data from the ADCs as well as from other sources
are coordinated and made available for use by
researchers at the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating
Center, established in 1999.

Amblyopia
Definition
Amblyopia is an uncorrectable decrease in vision in
one or both eyes with no apparent structural abnormality
seen to explain it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning
that when a decrease in vision is detected, other causes
must be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-
opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two lines
or more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) between
the two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worse
would be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someone
has 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 with
the left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision with
corrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.
Description
Lazy eye is a common non-medical term used to
describe amblyopia because the eye with poorer vision
doesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia is
the most common cause of impaired vision in children,
affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%
of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarity
of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-
ing of those images by the brain. If the images produced
by the two eyes are substantially different, the brain may
not be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-
ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-
presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead to
amblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferring
one eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-
ment in the blurrier eye.
Causes and symptoms
Some of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:
•Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is
the most common cause of functional amblyopia. The
two eyes are looking in two different directions at the
same time. The brain is sent two different images and
this causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or
“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.
• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional
amblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-
tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-
ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). For
example, one eye may be more nearsighted than the
other eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the other
eye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the two
dissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrier
image, causing the eye to become amblyopic.
• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the
image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain
“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataract
may become amblyopic.
•Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light
cannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, the
eye is essentially not being used. This can lead to
amblyopia.
•Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-
tional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result in
amblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the B
vitaminsmay result in toxic amblyopia.
• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.
Barring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-
dren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Children
may hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor the
eye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing or
reaching for things when approached from the side of the
amblyopic eye. Parents should see if one side of

good eye is covered, the child may cry.
Diagnosis
Because children with outwardly normal eyes may
have amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision
screenings performed for all children. While there is
some controversy regarding the age children should have
their first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,
be examined at any age, even at one day of life.
Some recommend that children have their vision
checked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-
mologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.
Others recommend testing by at least the child’s fourth
birthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-
ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable after
age eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the better
the possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part of
a child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eye
problem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.
There are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to
measure the refractive status of the eyes. This can help
determine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-held
instrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or
infant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-
tion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined
using a variety of methods. Many different eye charts are
available (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters). In ambly-
opia, single letters are easier to recognize than when a
KEY TERMS
Anisometropia—An eye condition in which there
is an inequality of vision between the two eyes.
There may be unequal amounts of nearsighted-
ness, farsightedness, or astigmatism, so that one
eye will be in focus while the other will not.
Cataract—Cloudiness of the eye’s natural lens.
Occulsion therapy—A type of treatment for ambly-
opia in which the good eye is patched for a period
of time. This forces the weaker eye to be used.
Strabismus—A condition in which the eyes are
misaligned and point in different directions. One
eye may look straight ahead, while the other turns
inward, outward, upward, or downward. This is
also called crossed-eyes.
Visual acuity—Acuity is the acuteness or sharp-
ness of vision.
whole line is shown. This is called the “crowding effect”
and helps in diagnosing amblyopia. Neutral density filters
may also be held over the eye to aid in the diagnosis.
Sometimes visual fields to determine defects in the area
of vision will be performed. Color vision testing may also
be performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly-
opia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening
problems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami-
nation of the eyes and visual system is very important
when there is an unexplained decrease in vision.
Treatment
The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion
therapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye
(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopic
eye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too may
become amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment plan
should be discussed with the doctor to fully understand
how long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-
es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focus
and work. This is called vision therapy or vision training
(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in the
weak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-
od of years to maintain the improvement.
While patching is necessary to get the amblyopic
eye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason
for the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there are
errors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may be
necessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition is
indicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,
amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the good
eye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use the
amblyopic eye.
Prognosis
The younger the person, the better the chance for
improvement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev-
er, treatment may be successful in older children—even
adults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia also
depends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specific
type of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-
tant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-
nificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The best
outcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.
Prevention
To protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware
of amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness may
encourage parents to take young children for vision exams
early on in life—certainly before school age. Proper nutri-
tion is important in the avoidance of toxic amblyopia.

Amebiasis
Definition
Amebiasis is an infectious disease caused by a para-
sitic one-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Enta-
moeba histolytica. Persons with amebiasis may experi-
ence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea,
fever, and cramps. The disease may also affect the
intestines, liver, or other parts of the body.
Description
Amebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one
of the most common parasitic diseases occurring in
humans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each
year. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical
areas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-
quate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occur
in persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit any
symptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 people
die of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between
1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-
sis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrant
workers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrants
develop amebiasis at a higher rate.
Human beings are the only known host of the amebi-
asis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of age
or sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarily
spread in food and water that has been contaminated by
human feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-
tact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-
al outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces are
used as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-
plies contaminated with human feces.
Causes and symptoms
Recently, it has been discovered that persons with
symptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe-
ba histolytica, and those individuals who exhibit no
symptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-
looking ameba called Entamoeba dispar. During their
life cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:
the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move
but can survive outside the human body because of its
protective covering, and the disease-producing form, the
trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot
survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot
infect others. The disease is most commonly transmitted
when a person eats food or drinks water containing E.
histolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract
the cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls
of the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,
releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released within
the intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on
intestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large
intestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, the
trophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal
tissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).
The trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in the
intestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal wall
and be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or
other organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestines
eventually form new cysts that are carried through the
digestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorable
temperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur-
vive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin
the cycle again.
Although 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United
States are mild, pregnant women, children under two
years of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and

as canceror AIDSpatients and those individuals taking
prescription medications that suppress the immune sys-
tem, are at a greater risk for developing a severe infection.
The signs and symptoms of amebiasis vary accord-
ing to the location and severity of the infection and are
classified as follows:
Intestinal amebiasis
Intestinal amebiasis can be subdivided into several
categories:
ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION. Most persons with
amebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though
these individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable of
infecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-
minating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,
for example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.
CHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu-
als may experience symptoms over a long period of time
during a chronic amebiasis infection and experience
recurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to four
weeks and recur over a period of years. These patients
may also suffer from abdominal cramps,fatigue, and
weight loss.
AMEBIC DYSENTERY.In severe cases of intestinal
amebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-
tine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severe
abdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as
104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-
bic dysentery may cause complications, including
inflammation of the appendix (appendicitis), a tear in
the intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severe
inflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).
AMEBOMA.An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the
bowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can
result from either chronic intestinal infection or acute
amebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptoms
that mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.
PERIANAL ULCERS.Intestinal amebiasis may pro-
duce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus
(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”
appearance and are painful to the touch.
Extraintestinal amebiasis
Extraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-
ly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes all
forms of the disease that affect other organs.
The most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis
is amebic abscessof the liver. In the United States, ame-
bic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-
panic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result from
direct infection of the liver by E. histolyticaor as a com-
plication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebic
abscess of the liver complain of painin the chest or
abdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right side
directly above the liver.
Other forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though
rare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,
or genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-
tively high mortality rate.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly
because the disease can affect several areas of the body
and can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms to
being severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, a
physician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when a
patient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,
diarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure to
amebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,
or anal intercourse.
It is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and
another disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that
produces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-
rectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage the
growth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because of
the serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential cases
of IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samples
and blood tests, and a procedure involving a visual
inspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu-
lar instrument (sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.
A diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one
or more tests, depending on the location of the disease.
Stool examination
This test involves microscopically examining a stool
sample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E.
histolyticaand not one of the many other intestinal ame-
bas that are often found but that do not cause disease. A
series of three stool tests is approximately 90% accurate
in confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu-
nately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosing
amebomas or extraintestinal infections.
Sigmoidoscopy
Sigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in
which a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig-
moidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part of
the large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue or
fluid samples from the intestinal lining.

Amebiasis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 144  Blood tests
Although tests designed to detect a specific protein
produced in response to amebiasis infection (antibody) are
capable of detecting only about 10% of cases of mild ame-
biasis, these tests are extremely useful in confirming 95%
of dysentery diagnoses and 98% of liver abscess diag-
noses. Blood serum will usually test positive for antibody
within a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however,
cannot always distinguish between a current or past infec-
tion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood for
as long as 10 years following initial infection.
Imaging studies
A number of sophisticated imaging techniques, such
as computed tomography scans(CT),magnetic reso-
nance imaging(MRI), and ultrasound, can be used to
determine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat-
ed, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw a
sample of tissue to determine whether the abscess is
indeed caused by an amebic infection.
Treatment
Asymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may
require no treatment. However, because of the potential
for disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with a
medication to kill the disease-causing amebas. More
severe cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treated
by replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame-
bic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bed
rest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat-
ment can be complicated because different drugs may be
required to eliminate the parasite, based on the location
of the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame-
biasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories:
Luminal amebicides
These drugs get their name because they act on
organisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel.
They include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida-
zole, and paromomycin.
Tissue amebicides
Tissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the
liver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy-
droemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Because
these drugs have potentially serious side effects, patients
given emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest and
heart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be the
most useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess.
Patients taking metronidazole must avoid alcohol
because the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea,
vomiting, and headache.
KEY TERMS
Ameboma—A mass of tissue that can develop on
the wall of the colon in response to amebic infec-
tion.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Appendicitis—Condition characterized by the
rapid inflammation of the appendix, a part of the
intestine.
Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and
are usually capable of transmitting the disease but
who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are
said to be asymptomatic.
Dysentery—Intestinal infection marked by diar-
rhea containing blood and mucus.
Fulminating colitis—A potentially fatal complica-
tion of amebic dysentery marked by sudden and
severe inflammation of the intestinal lining, severe
bleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive shedding
of dead tissue.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—Disease in
which the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.
Lumen—The inner cavity or canal of a tube-
shaped organ, such as the bowel.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, differ-
ent from bacteria (prokaryotic).
Most patients are given a combination of luminal and
tissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven to ten
days. Follow-up care includes periodic stool examinations
beginning two to four weeks after the end of medication
treatment to check the effectiveness of drug therapy.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the location of the infection
and the patient’s general health prior to infection. The prog-
nosis is generally good, although the mortality rate is high-
er for patients with ameboma, perforation of the bowel, and
liver infection. Patients who develop fulminant colitis have
the most serious prognosis, with over 50% mortality.
Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medica-
tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-

ease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effective
personal and community hygiene.
Specific safeguards include the following:
• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified by
filtering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.
• Proper food handling. Measures include protecting
food from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-
ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and
before cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-
not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countries
with high rates of amebiasis.
• Careful disposal of human feces.
• Monitoring the contacts of amebiasis patients. The
stools of family members and sexual partners of infect-
ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts or
trophozoites.

Amenorrhea
Definition
The absence of menstrual periods is called amenor-
rhea. Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having a
period by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is more	common and refers to either the temporary or permanent	ending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-	mally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-	ly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or more	periods in a row.
Description
The absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not
a disease. While the average age that menstruation begins
is 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-
rhea in the United States is just 2.5%.
Some female athletes who participate in rowing,
long distance running, and cycling, may notice a few
missed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for
developing amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,
who typically exercisestrenuously and eat poorly.
Causes and symptoms
Amenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-
rhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-
atric disorders, eating disorders,malnutrition, excessive
thinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content too
low, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physical
training prior to pubertycan delay menarche (the onset
of menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-
che for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-
depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induce
amenorrhea.
Primary amenorrhea
However, the main cause is a delay in the beginning
of puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity or
poor nutrition) or because of a problem in the endocrine
system, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism. An
obstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus may
be the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,
endocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.
Typical causes of primary amenorrhea include:
• excessive physical activity
• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or
bulimia)
• extreme obesity
• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)
• chronic illness
• turner’s syndrome. (A chromosomal problem in place
at birth, relevant only in cases of primary amenorrhea)
• the absence of a vagina or a uterus

Amenorrhea

menstrual blood through)
Secondary amenorrhea
Some of the causes of primary amenorrhea can also
cause secondary amenorrhea—strenuous physical activi-
ty, excessive weight loss, use of antidepressants or tran-
quilizers, in particular. In adolescents,pregnancyand
stressare two major causes. Missed periods are usually
caused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-
ment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-
ods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, or
increased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-
sation of periods for four months should be evaluated.
The most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is
pregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarily
after she stops taking birth control pills. This temporary
halt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in some
cases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-
rhea may also be related to hormonal problems related to
stress, depression,anorexia nervosaor drugs, or it may
be caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as a
tumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-
nently after menopauseor a hysterectomy.
Polycystic ovary syndromeis another common cause
of secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-
ing many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels of
male hormones (androgens). This condition is related to
improper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releases
hormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-
mones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-
tics, such as acneand coarse body hair. If the condition is
not treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,
and chronically high levels of estrogen may increase the
chance of developing cancerof the uterine lining.
Diagnosis
It may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,
but the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-
cy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period is
two to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogen
deficiency, or other problems with the endocrine system
need to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-
roid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.
The diagnosis usually includes a patient history and
a physical exam (including a pelvic exam). If a woman
has missed three or more periods in a row, a physician
may recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,
a scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitary
tumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis to
rule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.
Treatment
Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-
mary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’s
always important to discover the cause of the problem in
any case. Not all conditions can be treated, but any
underlying condition that is treatable should be treated.
If a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-
terone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-
rect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birth
control pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor is
treated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certain
hormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bring
on a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessive
exercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods in
teen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed
for women with ovarian or uterine cysts.
Prognosis
Prolonged amenorrhea can lead to infertilityand other
medical problems such as osteoporosis(thinning of the
bones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stress
or illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-
es or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-
continuing birth control pills usually go away within six to
eight weeks, although it may take up to a year.
The prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends
on the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.
Spironolactone, a drug that blocks the production of
male hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If a
woman wishes to become pregnant, treatment with
clomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,
surgery on the ovaries.
Prevention
Primary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-
tion cannot be prevented. In general, however, women
should maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,
rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smokingand sub-
stance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal-
anced diet and rest and exercise normally. However,
many cases of amenorrhea cannot be prevented.

screening
Definition
Amino acid disorder screening checks for inherited
disorders in amino acid metabolism. Tests are most com-
monly done on newborns. Two tests are available, one
using a blood sample and the other a urine sample.
Purpose
Amino acid disorder screening is done in newborns,
and sometimes children and adults, to detect inborn
errors in metabolism of amino acids. Twenty of the 100
known amino acids are the main building blocks for
human proteins. Proteins regulate every aspect of cellular

function. Of these 20 amino acids, ten are not made by
the body and must be acquired through diet. Congenital
(present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect amino
acid metabolism or congenital abnormalities in the
amino acid transport system of the kidneys creates a con-
dition called aminoaciduria.
Screening is especially important in newborns.
Some congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause
mental retardationthat can prevented with prompt
treatment of the newborn. One of the best known exam-
ples of this is phenylketonuria(PKU). This is an genetic
error in metabolism of phenylalanine, an amino acid
found in milk. Individuals with PKU do not produce the
enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine.
PKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births in
the United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians and
less prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans.
Newborns in the United States are routinely screened for
PKU by a blood test.
There are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary or
overflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in the
enzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids. Overflow
aminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test.
Secondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because of
a congenital defect in the amino acid transport system in
the tubules of the kidneys. This produces increased
amino acids in the urine. Blood and urine test in combi-
nation are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is of
the overflow or renal type. Urine tests are also used to
monitor specific amino acid disorders.
Newborns are screened for amino acid disorders.
Young children with acidosis (accumulation of acid in
the body), severe vomiting and diarrhea, or urine with
an abnormal color or odor, are also screened with a urine
test for specific amino acid levels.
Precautions
Both blood and urine tests are simple tests that can
be done in a doctor’s office or clinic. These tests can be
done on even the youngest patients.
Description
Two types of amino acid screening tests are used
together to diagnose amino acid disorders.

amount of blood from a baby’s heel. The procedure is
rapid and relatively painless. Total time for the test is less
than ten minutes. The blood is sent to a laboratory where
results will be available in about two days.

Amino acid disorders screening
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 148  Urine test
In the urine test, the patient is asked to urinate into a
collecting cup. For an infant, the urine is collected in a pedi-
atric urine collector. The process is painless. The length of
time the test takes is determined by how long it takes the
patient to urinate. Results also take about two days.
Both these tests use thin layer chromatography to
separate the amino acids present. Using this technique,
the amino acids form a characteristic patterns on a glass
plate coated with a thin layer of silica gel. This pattern is
then compared to the normal pattern to determine if there
are abnormalities.
Preparation
Before the blood test, the patient must not eat or
drink for four hours. Failure to fast will alter the results
of the test.
The patient should eat and drink normally before the
urine test. Some drugs may affect the results of the urine
test. The technician handling the urine sample should be
informed of any medications the patient is taking. Moth-
ers of breastfeeding infants should report any medica-
tions they are taking, since these can pass from mother to
child in breast milk.
Aftercare
The blood screening is normally done first. Depend-
ing on the results, it is followed by the urine test. It takes
both tests to distinguish between overflow and renal
aminoaciduria. Also, if the results are abnormal, a 24-
hour urine test is performed along with other tests to
determine the levels of specific amino acids. In the event
of abnormal results, there are many other tests that will
be performed to determine the specific amino acid
involved in the abnormality.
Risks
There are no particular risks associated with either
of these tests. Occasionally minor bruising may occur at
the site where the blood was taken.
Normal results
The pattern of amino acid banding on the thin layer
chromatography plates will be normal.
Abnormal results
The blood plasma amino acid pattern is abnormal in
overflow aminoaciduria and is normal in renal
aminoaciduria. The pattern is abnormal in the urine test,
suggesting additional tests need to be done to determine

Aminoglycosides
Definition
Aminoglycosides are a group of antibioticsthat are
used to treat certain bacterial infections. This group of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	149
Aminoglycosides
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 149  antibiotics includes at least eight drugs: amikacin, gen-
tamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, paro-
momycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. All of these
drugs have the same basic chemical structure.
Purpose
Aminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec-
tions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte-
ria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. In
Gram’s staining, a film of material containing the possible
bacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide is
stained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off with
water and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodine
solution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed off
and the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide is
then stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safranine
for 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram-
positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega-
tive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-
fully be combated with aminoglycosides include
Pseudomonas,Acinetobacter, and Enterobacterspecies,
among others. Aminoglycosides are also effective against
mycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis.
The aminoglycosides can be used against certain
Gram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employed
because other antibiotics are more effective and have
fewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffective
against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow in
the presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And only
one aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-
sitic infection.
Like all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not
effective against influenza, the common cold, or other
viral infections.
Precautions
Pre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-
ease, eighth cranial nerve disease,myasthenia gravis, and
Parkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to taking
any aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advised
against taking aminoglycosides, because their infants may
suffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-
ance. However, those factors need to be considered along-
side the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases of
serious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breast
milk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-
scribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.
Description
Streptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated
from Streptomyces griseusin the mid-1940s. This antibiot-
ic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main
drawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cells
in the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,
some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment with
streptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-
siderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-
tomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.
Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the
gastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-
ly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished in
quantity. The route of drug administration depends on the
type and location of the infection being treated. The typi-
cal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-
tion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection into
a vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.
If the infection being treated involves the central nervous
system, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.
The bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not
been fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches to
a bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-
nels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,
the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.
Ribosomes are the intracellular structures responsible for
manufacturing proteins. This attachment either shuts
down protein production or causes the cell to produce
abnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannot
survive with this impediment.
Antibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may
pair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually a
beta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.
Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cell
wall, making it more porous. The increased porosity
allows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.
Traditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at
even doses given throughout the day. It was thought that
a steady plasma concentration was necessary to combat
infection. However, this administration schedule is time
and labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a single
daily dose can be as effective, or more effective, than
several doses throughout the day.
Dosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,
and general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-
neys, it is important to assess any underlying problems
with kidney function. Kidney function is assessed by
measuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-
mally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is an
indication that the kidneys may not be functioning at an
optimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.
Risks
Aminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-
tain cells in the ears and in the kidneys. Approximately 5-

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 150  10% of the people who are treated with aminoglycosides
experience some side effect, affecting their hearing, sense
of balance, or kidneys. However, in most cases the dam-
age is minor and reversible once medication is stopped.
If cells in the inner ear are damaged or destroyed, an
individual may experience a loss of balance and feelings
of dizziness. Damage to the middle ear may result in
hearing lossor tinnitus. Neomycin, kanamycin, and
amikacin are the most likely to cause problems with
hearing, and streptomycin and gentamicin carry the
greatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance. Kid-
ney damage, apparent with changes in urination frequen-
cy or urine production, is most likely precipitated by
neomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin.
Young children and the elderly are at the greatest
risk of suffering side effects. Excessive dosage or poor
clearance of the drug from the body can be injurious at
any age.
Less common side effects include skin rashesand
itching. Very rarely, certain aminoglycosides may cause
difficulty in breathing, weakness, or drowsiness. Gen-
tamicin, when injected, may cause leg cramps, skin rash,
fever, or seizures.
If side effects linger or become worse after medica-
tion is stopped, it is advisable to seek medical advice.
Side effects that may be of concern include tinnitus or
loss of hearing, dizziness or loss of balance, changes in
urination frequency or urine production, increased thirst,
appetite loss, and nausea or vomiting.
Normal results
At the proper dosage and in the presence of gram-
negative enteric (intestinal) bacteria, aminoglycosides
are very effective in treating an infection.
Abnormal results
In some cases, bacteria are resistant to antibiotics
that would normally kill them. This resistance becomes
apparent after repeated exposure to the antibiotic and
arises from a mutation that alters the bacteria’s suscepti-
bility to the drug. Various degrees of resistance have been
observed in bacteria that normally would be destroyed by
aminoglycosides. In general, though, aminoglycoside
effectiveness has held up well over time.

Amnesia
Definition
Amnesia refers to the loss of memory. Memory loss
may result from two-sided (bilateral) damage to parts of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	151
Amnesia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 151  the brain vital for memory storage, processing, or recall
(the limbic system, including the hippocampus in the
medial temporal lobe).
Description
Amnesia can be a symptom of several neurodegen-
erative diseases; however, people whose primary symp-
tom is memory loss (amnesiacs), typically remain lucid
and retain their sense of self. They may even be aware
that they suffer from a memory disorder.
People who experience amnesia have been instrumen-
tal in helping brain researchers determine how the brain
processes memory. Until the early 1970s, researchers
viewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-
ences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioning
were grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-
cific area of the brain.
If all memory were stored in the same way, it would
be reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brain
area would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-
ies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such research
demonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-
cessing, storing, and drawing on memory.
Causes and symptoms
Amnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable
to brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-
tion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to
the brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome, for example, damage to the memory centers
of the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-
tion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including
encephalitisand herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the
amnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it is
termed psychogenic.
There are at least three general types of amnesia:
• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-
ma and is characterized by the inability to remember
new information. Recent experiences and short-term
memory disappear, but victims can recall events prior
to the trauma with clarity.
• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the
opposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recall
events that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-
ber previously familiar information or the events pre-
ceding the trauma.
• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no
consistently identifiable cause, but researchers have
suggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacks
may be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack,
sometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when a
blockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-
ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences sudden
confusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as
30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severe
attacks, a person is completely disoriented and may
experience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-
al years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-
sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-
sis for recovery.
Diagnosis
In diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at
several factors. During a physical examination, the doc-
tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug and
medication history, and checks the patient’s general
health. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-
mine the extent of amnesia and the memory system
affected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such as
magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) to reveal whether
the brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude
treatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and
is handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause,
cognitive rehabilitationmay be helpful in learning
strategies to cope with memory impairment.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 152  Prognosis
Some types of amnesia, such as transient global
amnesia, are completely resolved and there is no perma-
nent loss of memory. Others, such as Korsakoff syn-
drome, associated with prolonged alcohol abuse or
amnesias caused by severe brain injury, may be perma-
nent. Depending on the degree of amnesia and its cause,
victims may be able to lead relatively normal lives.
Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on other
memory systems to compensate for what is lost.
Prevention
Amnesia is only preventable in so far as brain injury
can be prevented or minimized. Common sense approach-
es include wearing a helmet when bicycling or participat-
ing in potentially dangerous sports, using automobile seat
belts, and avoiding excessive alcohol or drug use. Brain
infections should be treated swiftly and aggressively to
minimize the damage due to swelling. Victims of strokes,
brain aneurysms, and transient ischemic attacks should
seek immediate medical treatment.

Explicit memory—Conscious recall of facts and
events that is classified into episodic memory

(does not involve time and place). For example, an
amnesiac may remember he has a wife (semantic
memory), but cannot recall his last conversation

Amniocentesis
Definition
Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose fetal
defects in the early second trimester of pregnancy. A
sample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus in
the womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’s
abdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed on
fetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence of
many types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctors
and prospective parents to make important decisions
about early treatment and intervention.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	153
Amniocentesis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 153  Purpose
Since the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used
routinely to test for Down syndrome, by far the most
common, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflicting
about one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately
800 different diagnostic tests were available, most of
them for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs
disease, sickle cell anemia,hemophilia,muscular dys-
trophyand cystic fibrosis.
Amniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended
for women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. It
is also recommended for women who have already borne
children with birth defects, or when either of the parents
has a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-
tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is to
confirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other
defects which may have shown up previously during rou-
tine maternal blood screening.
The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary
genetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-
ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greater
the risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to begin
amnio testing because that is the age at which the risk of
carrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals the
risk of miscarriagecaused by the procedure—about
one in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a child
with this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45
it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-
nant women over 35 in the United States undergo
amniocentesis and many younger women also decide to
have the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Down
syndrome infants born in the United States each year are
to women younger than 35.
One of the most common reasons for performing
amniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus
and present in the mother’s blood. A simple blood
screening, usually conducted around the 15th week of
pregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’s
blood. Levels that are too high or too low may signal
possible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-
positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommended
whenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.
Amniocentesis is generally performed during the
16th week of pregnancy, with results usually available
within three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio as
early as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-
ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-
carriage when done at this time. The advantage of early
amnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-
sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatment
of the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the fact
that elective abortions are safer and less controversial the
earlier they are performed.
Precautions
As an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,
although small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents must
weigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, or
indeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small risk
of damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. The
serious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse test
results can bring must also be considered. The decision to
undergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.
Description
The word amniocentesis literally means “puncture
of the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a
developing fetus is suspended during pregnancy. During
the sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a very
fine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterus
and amniotic sac and withdraws approximately one
ounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-
less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-
times using local anesthesia.
The physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-
dle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-
ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-
dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the woman
can return home after a brief observation period. She
may be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and to
avoid heavy lifting for two days.
The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory
where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated and
grown in order to provide enough genetic material for
testing. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material is
then extracted and treated so that visual examination for
defects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,
the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound in
the amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.
Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill of
the lab conducting them, all the results are available
between one and four weeks after the sample is taken.
Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,
and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage for
women over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternal
blood screening results, and when genetic disorders run
in the family.
An alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori-
onic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be performed as
early as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allows
for the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant-
ed, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive.

ing involves expanding the scope and accuracy of mater-
nal blood screening as this poses no risk to the fetus.
Preparation
It is important for a woman to fully understand the
procedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician per-
forming it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s experi-
ence with the procedure reduces the chance of mishap.
Almost all obstetricians are experienced in performing
amniocentesis. The patient should feel free to ask ques-
tions and seek emotional support before, during and after
the amnio is performed.
Aftercare
Necessary aftercare falls into two categories, physi-
cal and emotional.
Physical aftercare
During and immediately following the sampling
procedure, a woman may experience dizziness, nausea, a
rapid heartbeat, and cramping. Once past these immedi-
ate hurdles, the physician will send the woman home
with instructions to rest and to report any complications
requiring immediate treatment, including:
• vaginal bleeding. The appearance of blood could signal
a problem.
•premature labor. Unusual abdominal painand/or
cramping may indicate the onset of premature labor.
Mild cramping for the first day or two following the
procedure is normal.
• signs of infection. Leaking of amniotic fluid or unusual
vaginal discharge, and fevercould signal the onset of
infection.
Emotional aftercare
Once the procedure has been safely completed, the
anxietyof waiting for the test results can prove to be the
worst part of the process. A woman should seek and
receive emotional support from family and friends, as
well as from her obstetrician and family doctor. Profes-
sional counseling may also prove necessary, particularly
if a fetal defect is discovered.

Most of the risks and short-term side effects associ-
ated with amniocentesis relate to the sampling procedure
and have been discussed above. A successful amnio sam-
pling results in no long-term side effects. Risks include:
• maternal/fetal hemorrhaging. While spotting in preg-
nancy is fairly common, bleeding following amnio
should always be investigated.
• infection. Infection, although rare, can occur after
amniocentesis. An unchecked infection can lead to
severe complications.
• fetal injury. A very slight risk of injury to the fetus
resulting from contact with the amnio needle does exist.
• miscarriage. The rate of miscarriage occurring during
standard, second trimester amnio appears to be approx-
imately 0.5%. This compares to a miscarriage rate of
KEY TERMS
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)—A protein normally pro-
duced by the liver of a fetus and detectable in
maternal blood samples. AFP screening measures
the amount of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood. Levels
outside the norm may indicate fetal defects.
Anencephaly—A hereditary defect resulting in the
partial to complete absence of a brain and spinal
cord. It is fatal.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)—A procedure simi-
lar to amniocentesis, except that cells are taken from
the chorionic membrane for testing. These cells,
called chorionic villus cells, eventually become the
placenta. The samples are collected either through
the abdomen, as in amnio, or through the vagina.
CVS can be done earlier in the pregnancy than
amnio, but carries a somewhat higher risk.
Chromosome—Chromosomes are the strands of
genetic material in a cell that occur in nearly identi-
cal pairs. Normal human cells contain 23 chromo-
some pairs—one in each pair inherited from the
mother, and one from the father. Every human cell
contains the exact same set of chromosomes.
Down syndrome—The most prevalent of a class of
genetic defects known as trisomies, in which cells
contain three copies of certain chromosomes rather
than the usual two. Down syndrome, or trisomy 21,
usually results from three copies of chromosome 21.
Genetic—The term refers to genes, the basic units
of biological heredity, which are contained on the
chromosomes, and contain chemical instructions
which direct the development and functioning of an
individual.
Hereditary—Something which is inherited—passed
down from parents to offspring. In biology and
medicine, the word pertains to inherited genetic
characteristics.
Maternal blood screening—Maternal blood screen-
ing is normally done early in pregnancy to test for a
variety of conditions. Abnormal amounts of certain
proteins in a pregnant woman’s blood raise the
probability of fetal defects. Amniocentesis is recom-
mended if such a probability occurs.
Tay-Sachs disease—An inherited disease prevalent
among the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the
United States. Infants with the disease are unable to
process a certain type of fat which accumulates in

Negative results from an amnio analysis indicate
that everything about the fetus appears normal and the
pregnancy can continue without undue concern. A nega-
tive result for Down syndrome means that it is 99% cer-
tain that the disease does not exist.
An overall “normal” result does not, however, guar-
antee that the pregnancy will come to term, or that the
fetus does not suffer from some other defect. Laboratory
tests are not 100% accurate at detecting targeted condi-
tions, nor can every possible fetal condition be tested for.

Amputation
Definition
Amputation is the intentional surgical removal of a
limb or body part. It is performed to remove diseased tis-
sue or relieve pain.
Purpose
Arms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can all be
amputated. Most amputations involve small body parts
such as a finger, rather than an entire limb. About 65,000
amputations are performed in the United States each year.
Amputation is performed for the following reasons:
• to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate blood
supply
• to remove malignant tumors
• because of severe trauma to the body part
The blood supply to an extremity can be cut off
because of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of the
arteries,arterial embolism, impaired circulation as a
complication of diabetes mellitus, repeated severe infec-
tion that leads to gangrene, severe frostbite,Raynaud’s
disease, or Buerger’s disease.
More than 90% of amputations performed in the
United States are due to circulatory complications of dia-
betes. Sixty to eighty percent of these operations involve
the legs.
Precautions
Amputations cannot be performed on patients with
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,heart failure, or infec-

good candidates for amputation.
Description
Amputations can be either planned or emergency
procedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the main
reasons for emergency amputations. The operation is
performed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-
eral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.
Details of the operation vary slightly depending on
what part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations is
twofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound will
heal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow the
attachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.
The surgeon makes an incision around the part to be
amputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.
A flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, and
skin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closed
over the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remain
in place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing or
cast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.
Preparation
Before an amputation is performed, extensive testing
is done to determine the proper level of amputation. The
goal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing is
most likely to be complete, while allowing the maximum
amount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation.
The greater the blood flow through an area, the more
likely healing is to occur. These tests are designed to mea-
sure blood flow through the limb. Several or all of them
can be done to help choose the proper level of amputation.
• measurement of blood pressure in different parts of the
limb
• xenon 133 studies, which use a radiopharmaceutical to
measure blood flow
• oxygen tension measurements in which an oxygen elec-
trode is used to measure oxygen pressure under the skin

pressure reads higher than 40mm Hg (40 milliliters of
mercury), healing of the area is likely to be satisfactory.
• laser Doppler measurements of the microcirculation of
the skin
• skin fluorescent studies that also measure skin micro-
circulation
• skin perfusion measurements using a blood pressure
cuff and photoelectric detector
• infrared measurements of skin temperature
No one test is highly predictive of healing, but taken
together, the results give the surgeon an excellent idea of
the best place to amputate.
Aftercare
After amputation, medication is prescribed for pain,
and patients are treated with antibioticsto discourage
infection. The stump is moved often to encourage good
circulation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are started
as soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies have
shown that there is a positive relationship between early
rehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump and
prosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the
severity of the amputation and the general health of the
amputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks.
Rehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially
for above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera-
py is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel-
ing is an important part of rehabilitation. Many people
feel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body part.
Others are bothered by phantom limb syndrome, where
they feel as if the amputated part is still in place. They
may even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Many
amputees benefit from joining self-help groups and
meeting others who are also living with amputation.
Addressing the emotional aspects of amputation often
speeds the physical rehabilitation process.
Risks
Amputation is major surgery. All the risks associated
with the administration of anesthesia exist, along with
the possibility of heavy blood loss and the development
of blood clots. Infection is of special concern to
amputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. If
the stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove the
prosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at a
higher level.
Failure of the stump to heal is another major compli-
cation. Nonhealing is usually due to an inadequate blood
supply. The rate of nonhealing varies from 5-30%
KEY TERMS
Arterial embolism—A blood clot arising from
another location that blocks an artery.
Buerger’s disease—An episodic disease that caus-
es inflammation and blockage of the veins and

depending on the facility. Centers that specialize in ampu-
tation usually have the lowest rates of complication.
Persistent pain in the stump or pain in the phantom
limb is experienced by most amputees to some degree.
Treatment of phantom limb pain is difficult. One final
complication is that many amputees give up on the reha-
bilitation process and discard their prosthesis. Better fit-
ting prosthetics and earlier rehabilitation have decreased
the incidence of this problem.
Normal results
The five year survival rate for all lower extremity
amputees is less than 50%. For diabetic amputees, the
rate is less than 40%. Up to 50% of people who have
one leg amputated because of diabetes will lose the
other within five years. Amputees who walk using a
prosthesis have a less stable gait. Three to five percent
of these people fall and break bones because of this
instability. Although the fracturescan be treated, about
half the amputees who suffer them then remain wheel-
chair bound.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 159  Amylase tests
Definition
Amylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily by
the pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are sub-
stances made and used by the body to trigger specific
chemical reactions. The primary function of the enzyme
amylase is to break down starches in food so that they
can be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually done
to determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain.
Purpose
Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a number
of diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for
example, is the most common reason for a high amylase
level. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapes
from the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hours
after the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start to
rise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-
ally returning to normal.
There are other causes of increased amylase. An
ulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes into
the pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.
During a mumpsinfection, amylase from the inflamed
salivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in the
liver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation of
these tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,
tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning, ruptured
aortic aneurysm, and intestinal strangulation or perfora-
tion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.
Precautions
This is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-
ease.
Description
Amylase testing is done on both blood and urine.
The laboratory may use any of several testing methods
that involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-
stance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-
ing the end-product or the reaction time, technicians can
calculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.
More sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-
lase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by the
salivary glands.
Urine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-
lase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylase
from the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10
hours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine is
usually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.	Results are usually available the same day.
Preparation
In most cases, no special preparation is necessary for
a person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients taking
longer term urine amylase tests will be given a container
and instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urine
should be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site
or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-
ture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-
ing warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and the
method used.
Abnormal results
Eight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will
have high amylase levels, up to four times the normal
level. Other causes of increased amylase, such as
mumps, kidney failure,pregnancyoccurring in the
abdomen but outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy),
certain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complications
of diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer, are further
investigated based on the person’s symptoms, medical
history, and the results of other tests.
In kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at
removing amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in the
blood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.
People with macroamylasia have large clumps of
amylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to
move through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-
lase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urine
will be low.
Amylase levels may be low in severe liver disease
(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas
fails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions
(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build up
in the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), following
burns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic
fibrosis. Some medications can raise or lower levels.

Amyloidosis
Definition
Amyloidosis is a progressive, incurable, metabolic
disease characterized by abnormal deposits of protein in
one or more organs or body systems.
Description
Amyloid proteins are manufactured by malfunction-
ing bone marrow. Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu-
mulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function,
can cause organ failure or death. It is a rare disease,
occurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. It
affects males and females equally and usually develops
after the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis have
been identified. Each one is associated with deposits of a
different kind of protein.
Types of amyloidosis
The major forms of this disease are primary sys-
temic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis.
There is also another form of amyloidosis associated
with Alzheimer’s disease.
Primary systemic amyloidosis usually develops
between the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 new
cases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosis

the pancreas and salivary glands.

Pancreatitis—Inflammation of the pancreas.
is the most common form of this disease in the United
States. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it
may also occur in association with multiple myeloma
(bone marrow cancer).
Secondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-
tion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:
•familial Mediterranean fever(a bacterial infection
characterized by chills, weakness,headache, and
recurring fever)
• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-
tine)
• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)
• leprosy
• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone
marrow)
• rheumatoid arthritis
Familial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-
ited form of the disease. It occurs in members of most
ethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive pattern
of symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-
dosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which means
that only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to
cause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-
loidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.
Amyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the
body. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and
nervous system are affected most often. Other common
sites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints,
liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most patients
have gastrointestinal abnormalities, but other symptoms
vary according to the organ(s) or system(s) affected by
the disease. Usually the affected organs are rubbery, firm,
and enlarged.
Heart
Because amyloid protein deposits can limit the
heart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even the
slightest exertion can cause shortness of breath. If the
heart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s rhythm
may become erratic. The heart may also be enlarged and
heart murmursmay be present. Congestive heart fail-
uremay result.
Kidneys
The feet, ankles, and calves swell when amyloidosis
damages the kidneys. The kidneys become small and

Amyloidosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 161  hard, and kidney failure may result. It is not unusual for a
patient to lose 20-25 pounds and develop a distaste for
meat, eggs, and other protein-rich foods. Cholesterol ele-
vations that don’t respond to medication and protein in
the urine (proteinuria) are common.
Nervous system
Nervous system symptoms often appear in patients
with familial amyloidosis. Inflammation and degenera-
tion of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy)
may be present. One of four patients with amyloidosis
has carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful disorder that
causes numbness or tingling in response to pressure on
nerves around the wrist. Amyloidosis that affects nerves
to the feet can cause burning or numbness in the toes and
soles and eventually weaken the legs. If nerves control-
ling bowel function are involved, bouts of diarrhea
alternate with periods of constipation. If the disease
affects nerves that regulate blood pressure, patients may
feel dizzy or faint when they stand up suddenly.
Liver and spleen
The most common symptoms are enlargement of
these organs. Liver function is not usually affected until
quite late in the course of the disease. Protein accumula-
tion in the spleen can increase the risk of rupture of this
organ due to trauma.
Gastrointestinal system
The tongue may be inflammed, enlarged, and stiff.
Intestinal movement (motility) may be reduced. Absorp-
tion of food and other nutrients may be impaired (and
may lead to malnutrition), and there may also be bleed-
ing, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.
Skin
Skin symptoms occur in about half of all cases of
primary and secondary amyloidosis and in all cases
where there is inflammation or degeneration of the
peripheral nerves. Waxy-looking raised bumps (papules)

may appear on the face and neck, in the groin, armpits, or
anal area, and on the tongue or in the ear canals.
Swelling, hemorrhage beneath the skin (purpura), hair
loss, and dry mouthmay also occur.
Respiratory system
Airways may be obstructed by amyloid deposits in
the nasal sinus, larynx and traches (windpipe).
Diagnosis
Blood and urine tests can reveal the presence of
amyloid protein, but tissue or bone-marrow biopsy is
necessary to positively diagnose amyloidosis. Once the
diagnosis has been confirmed, additional laboratory tests
and imaging procedures are performed to determine:
• which type of amyloid protein is involved
• which organ(s) or system(s) have been affected
• how far the disease has progressed
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to slow down or stop pro-
duction of amyloid protein, eliminate existing amyloid
deposits, alleviate underlying disorders (that give rise to
secondary amyloidosis), and relieve symptoms caused by
heart or kidney damage. Specialists in cardiology, hema-
tology (the study of blood and the tissues that form it),
nephrology (the study of kidney function and abnormali-
ties), neurology (the study of the nervous system), and
rheumatology (the study of disorders characterized by
inflammation or degeneration of connective tissue) work
together to assess a patient’s medical status and evaluate
the effects of amyloidosis on every part of the body.
Colchicine (Colebenemid, Probeneaid), prednisone,
(Prodium), and other anti-inflammatory drugs can slow
or stop disease progression. Bone-marrow and stem-cell
transplants can enable patients to tolerate higher and
more effective doses of melphalan (Alkeran) and other
chemotherapydrugs prescribed to combat this non-
malignant disease. Surgery can relieve nerve pressure
and may be performed to correct other symptom-produc-
ing conditions. Localized amyloid deposits can also be
removed surgically. Dialysis or kidney transplantation
can lengthen and improve the quality of life for patients
whose amyloidosis results in kidney failure. Heart trans-
plants are rarely performed.
Supportive measures
Although no link has been established between diet
and development of amyloid proteins, a patient whose
heart or kidneys have been affected by the disease may
be advised to use a diuretic or follow a low-salt diet.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2162
Amyloidosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 162  Prognosis
Most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed after the
disease has reached an advanced stage. The course of
each patient’s illness is unique but death, usually a result
of heart disease or kidney failure, generally occurs within
a few years. Amyloidosis associated by multiple myelo-
ma usually has a poor prognosis. Most patients with both
diseases die within one to two years.
Prevention
Genetic counselingmay be helpful for patients with
hereditary amyloidosis and their families. Use of
cholchicine in patients with familial Mediterranean fever
has successfully prevented amyloidosis.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Definition
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that
breaks down tissues in the nervous system (a neurode-
generative disease) of unknown cause that affects the
nerves responsible for movement. It is also known as
motor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the
baseball player whose career it ended.
Description
ALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve
cells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper
motor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral
nerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-
ment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,
leading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-	ly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-	tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,	such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of	itself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, the	heart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-	tem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people with	ALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-	er, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss of	intellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.
“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a
cardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of the
regions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”
describes the hardened tissue that develops in place of
healthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 people
in the United States, with about 5,000 new cases each
year. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,
although younger onset is possible. Men are slightly
more likely to develop ALS than women.
ALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal
within three years for 50% of all people affected, and
within five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with
ALS live beyond eight years.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
The symptoms of ALS are caused by the deathof
motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, these
neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the
muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,
neck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles they
enervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weakness
results. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to muscle
wasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motor
neurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, and
abnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neurons
causes muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).
Although many causes of motor neuron degenera-
tion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet been
proven responsible. Results of recent research have
implicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-
cals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of events
leads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-
rons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should be
produced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether this
excess is the cause or the effect of other degenerative
processes. Additional agents within this toxic cascade
may include excessive levels of a neurotransmitter
known as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motor
neurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, and
a faulty detoxificationenzyme known as SOD-1, for

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 163  superoxide dismutase type 1. The actual pathway of
destruction is not known, however, nor is the trigger for
the rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further research
may show that other pathways are involved, perhaps ones
even more important than this one. Autoimmune factors
or premature agingmay play some role, as could viral
agents or environmental toxins.
Two major forms of ALS are known: familial and
sporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALS
cases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to be
caused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes.
About 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta-
tions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom-
inant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to develop
the disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a
50% chance of passing the gene along to a child.
Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While many
environmental toxins have been suggested as causes, to
date no research has confirmed any of the candidates
investigated, including aluminum and mercury and lead
from dental fillings. As research progresses, it is likely
that many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have a
genetic basis as well.
A third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs in
Guam and other Pacific islands. This form combines
symptoms of both ALS and Parkinson’s disease.
Symptoms
The earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness in
the arms or legs, usually more pronounced on one side
than the other at first. Loss of function is usually more

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the degeneration and death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain.
These neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,
neck, and head. As motor neurons degenerate, the muscles are weakened and cannot move as effectively, leading to muscle
wasting.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 164  rapid in the legs among people with familial ALS and in
the arms among those with sporadic ALS. Leg weakness
may first become apparent by an increased frequency of
stumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-
culty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-
ty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss of
dexterity in the fingers.
Less often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in
the bulbarmuscles, those muscles in the mouth and
throat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. A
person with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tired
after speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.
In addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of
ALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-
ulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomes
obvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people without
the disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.
While initial weakness may be limited to one region,
ALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtually
all the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-
toms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms and
hands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold the
head up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makes
breathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-
trol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-
ration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-
tion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilator
and scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS may
live much longer than the average, although weakness and
wasting will continue to erode any remaining functional
abilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain function
of the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowing
some communication to take place with simple blinks or
through use of a computer-assisted device.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-
ical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-
ination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-
ness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-
tromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-
nostic process. Various other tests, including blood and
urine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule out
other possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors of
the skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-
ease, spinal arthritis,lead poisoning, or severe vitamin
deficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care-
ful review of all these factors.
Treatment
There is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that can
significantly alter its course. There are many things
KEY TERMS
Aspiration—Inhalation of food or liquids into the
lungs.
Bulbar muscles—Muscles of the mouth and throat
responsible for speech and swallowing.
Fasciculations—Involuntary twitching of muscles.
Motor neuron—A nerve cell that controls a mus-
cle.
Riluzole (Rilutek)—The first drug approved in the
United States for the treatment of ALS.
Voluntary muscle—A muscle under conscious

muscle which are not under voluntary control.
which can be done, however, to help maintain quality of
life and to retain functional ability even in the face of
progressive weakness.
As of early 1998, only one drug had been approved
for treatment of ALS. Riluzole (Rilutek) appears to pro-
vide on average a three-month increase in life expectancy
when taken regularly early in the disease, and shows a
significant slowing of the loss of muscle strength. Rilu-
zole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve ter-
minals. Experimental trials of nerve growth factor have
not demonstrated any benefit. No other drug or vitamin
currently available has been shown to have any effect on
the course of ALS.
A physical therapist works with an affected person
and family to implement exerciseand stretching pro-
grams to maintain strength and range of motion, and to
promote general health. Swimming may be a good
choice for people with ALS, as it provides a low-impact
workout to most muscle groups. One result of chronic
inactivity is contracture, or muscle shortening. Contrac-
tureslimit a person’s range of motion, and are often
painful. Regular stretching can prevent contracture. Sev-
eral drugs are available to reduce cramping, a common
complaint in ALS.
An occupational therapist can help design solutions
to movement and coordination problems, and provide
advice on adaptive devices and home modifications.
Speech and swallowing difficulties can be mini-
mized or delayed through training provided by a speech-
language pathologist. This specialist can also provide
advice on communication aids, including computer-
assisted devices and simpler word boards.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 165  Nutritional advice can be provided by a nutritionist.
A person with ALS often needs softer foods to prevent
jaw exhaustion or choking. Later in the disease,nutri-
tionmay be provided by a gastrostomytube inserted
into the stomach.
Mechanical ventilation may be used when breathing
becomes too difficult. Modern mechanical ventilators are
small and portable, allowing a person with ALS to main-
tain the maximum level of function and mobility. Ventila-
tion may be administered through a mouth or nose piece,
or through a tracheostomy tube. This tube is inserted
through a small hole made in the windpipe. In addition to
providing direct access to the airway, the tube also
decreases the risk aspiration. While many people with
rapidly progressing ALS choose not to use ventilators for
lengthy periods, they are increasingly being used to pro-
long life for a short time.
The progressive nature of ALS means that most per-
sons will eventually require full-time nursing care. This
care is often provided by a spouse or other family mem-
ber. While the skills involved are not difficult to learn,
the physical and emotional burden of care can be over-
whelming. Caregivers need to recognize and provide for
their own needs as well as those of people with ALS, to
prevent depression, burnout, and bitterness.
Throughout the disease, a support group can provide
important psychological aid to affected persons and their
caregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALS
inflicts. Support groups are sponsored by both the ALS
Society and the Muscular DystrophyAssociation.
Alternative treatment
Given the grave prognosis and absence of tradition-
al medical treatments, it is not surprising that a large
number of alternative treatments have been tried for
ALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested that
amino-acid therapies may provide some improvement
for some people with ALS. While individual reports
claim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi-
cine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi-
dence suggests that these offer any more than a brief
psychological boost, often followed by a more severe
letdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con-
tinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS are
better understood, alternative therapies may be more
intensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi-
cals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,
antioxidant vitaminsand supplements may be used
more routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, if
environmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera-
pies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be of
some use.
Prognosis
ALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to death
from respiratory infection within three to five years in
most cases. The slowest disease progression is seen in
those who are young and have their first symptoms in the
limbs. About 10% of people with ALS live longer than
eight years.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent ALS or to alter its
course.

Anaerobic infections
Definition
An anaerobic infection is an infection caused by
bacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the
presence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deep
wounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where there is
little oxygen. These infections are characterized by
abscessformation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue
destruction.
Description
Anaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-
teria grow in places which completely, or almost com-
pletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in the
mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.
Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria
include gas gangrene,tetanus, and botulism. Nearly all
dental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.
Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a
normal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)
is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,
the immune system kills any invading bacteria, but
sometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an
infection. Body sites that have tissue destruction
(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen
and favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low
oxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,
shock, injury, and surgery.
Anaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically
anywhere in the body. For example:
• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root
canals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,
and ears.
• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia, lung
abscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung (empye-
ma), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis).
• Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the
abdomen include abscess formation,peritonitis, and
appendicitis.
• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause
pelvic abscesses,pelvic inflammatory disease,
inflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), and
pelvic infections following abortion,childbirth, and
surgery.
• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common
causes of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructive
infection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-
tis), and bite wound infections.
• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can cause
brain and spinal cord abscesses.
• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the
bloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-
teremia).
Causes and symptoms
People who have experienced shock, injury, or
surgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumors
are at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-
ria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteria
which can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobic
infections are “mixed infections” which means that
there is a mixture of different bacteria growing. The
anaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infections
are Bacteroides fragilis,Peptostreptococcus, and
Clostridiumspecies.
The signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection
can vary depending on the location of the infection. In
general, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruc-

possibly fever. Symptoms for specific infections are
as follows:
• Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding
gums,bad breath, and pain. Severe infections may
produce oozing sores.
• Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad breath,
a bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense of choking.
• Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breath-
ing, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.
• Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-
lowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.
• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining
from the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,
and chills.
• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,
painful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.
Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,
and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drains
foul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may cause
extensive tissue destruction (necrosis).
• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever
(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, and
is potentially fatal.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-
marily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, and
location of the infection. A foul-smelling infection or
drainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic
infection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-
teria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late in
the infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection include
tissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. A
sample from the infected site may be obtained, using a
swab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-
ria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteria
can be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in the
laboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.
KEY TERMS
Abscess—A lump filled with pus resulting from an
infection.
Anaerobic—Living and growing in the absence of
oxygen.
Necrosis—Tissue death and destruction resulting
from infection or disease.
The recent medical history of the patient is helpful
in diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or
recently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel
disease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The
failure to improve following treatment with antibiotics
that aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that the
infection is caused by anaerobes. The location and type
of infection also help in the diagnosis.
Diagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if
bacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at
internal infections.
Treatment
Serious infections may require hospitalization for
treatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic
infections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify
the bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-
otic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work
against all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes are
killed by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-
zole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).
Other antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin
(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).
Surgical removal or drainage of the abscess is
almost always required. This may involve drainage by
needle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess
(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior to
the aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscesses
can be drained using this procedure with the help of
ultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualize
internal organs). This type of abscess drainage may be
performed in the doctor’s office.
Prognosis
Complete recovery should be achieved with the
appropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreated
or uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue and
bone destruction, which would require plastic surgery to
repair. Serious infections can be life threatening.
Prevention
Although anaerobic infections can occur in anyone,
good hygiene and general health may help to prevent
infections.

Anal atresia
Definition
The anus is either not present or it is in the wrong
place.
Description
There are basically two kinds of anal atresia. In boys
with high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula)
connecting the large intestine to either the urethra (which
delivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. In
girls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixty
percent of children with high anal atresia have other
defects, including problems with the esophagus, urinary
tract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel may
open in front of the circular mass of muscles that con-
strict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, in
boys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine ends
just under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali-
ties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every
5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.
A mother who has one child with these kind of condi-
tions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-
fers from this ailment.
Cause and symptoms
Anal atresia is a defect in the development of the
fetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play a
minor role.
Diagnosis
Usually a physician can make an obvious visual
diagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,
however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and
signs of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the
first or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-
iting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-
sia and the exact position, x rays will be taken which
include injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic
resonance imaging(MRI) or computed tomography
scans(CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-
niques used to determine the type and size of the anal
atresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass x
rays through the body at different angles, and an MRI
uses a magnetic field and radio waves.
KEY TERMS
Anus—The canal at the end of the large intestine
through which waste is excreted to the outside of
the body.
Bowel obstruction—Anything that prevents waste
from moving normally to the anal opening.
Colostomy—An operation where the large intes-
tine is diverted through an opening in the
abdomen and waste is excreted.
Feces—Bodily waste material that normally passes
through the anus.
Fistula—An abnormal channel that connects two
organs or connects an organ to the skin.
Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For
high anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,
a surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make a
temporary opening (colostomy) in the abdomen where
waste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine is
moved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part of
the anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy is
closed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-
ly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open the
area where the anus should be. If the channel is in the
wrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-
tion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,
the pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate or
widen the rectum and teaches the parents how to do this
daily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.
Prognosis
With high anal atresia, many children have problems
controlling bowel function. Most also become constipat-
ed. With low anal atresia, children generally have good
bowel control, but they may still become constipated.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent anal atresia.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 169  Anal cancer
Definition
Anal canceris an uncommon form of cancer affect-
ing the anus. The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long end
portion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solid
wastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestine
include the colon and the rectum.
Description
Different cancers can develop in different parts of
the anus, part of which is inside the body and part of
which is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the
anus are harmless in their early stages but may later
develop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example, con-
tain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.
Types of anal cancer include:
• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of
anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise
from the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.
The anal margin is the part of the anus that is half inside
and half outside the body, and the anal canal is the part
of the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form of
squamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma in
situ, or Bowen’s disease.
• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to
one-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.
These tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-
ca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal and
the rectum.
• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-
nocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. One
type of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal area
is called Paget’s disease, which can also affect the
vulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.
• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are
either basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,
two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, which
develop from skin cells that produce the brown pigment
called melanin, are far more common on areas of the
body exposed to the sun.
Approximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed
with anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-
als will die of the disease during this same interval,
according to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancers
are fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancers
affecting the digestive system. The disease affects
women somewhat more often than men, although the
number of cases among men, particularly homosexual
men, seems to be increasing.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,
although certain individuals appear to have a higher risk
of developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, as
are individuals with certain types of the human papillo-
mavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems in
the anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-
las. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-
tice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of anal
cancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex are
about 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-
erosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,
such individuals with HIV, or transplant patients taking
immunosuppressant drugs, are also at higher risk.
Most individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.
Symptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in
other harmless conditions. They include pain,itching
and bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,
change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the
stool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodes
in the anal or groin area.
Diagnosis
Anal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine
physicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoid
removal. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal
examination(DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,
lubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.
Individuals over the age of 50 who have no symptoms
should have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  five
to 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)
guidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.
Other diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:
Anoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a special
device to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure that
involves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-
srectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves are
used to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.
A biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;
that is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a
microscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-
form a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,
in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymph
nodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancer
hasn’t spread to these nodes.
Anal cancer severity is categorized by the following
stages:
• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of
anal tissue.
• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of
anal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2170
Anal cancer
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170  • Stage II anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of
anal tissue and is larger than 1 inch in diameter, but has
not spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.
• Stage IIIA anal cancer has spread to the lymph nodes
around the rectum or to nearby organs such as the vagi-
na or bladder.
• Stage IIIB anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the
mid-abdomen or groin, or to nearby organs and the
lymph nodes around the rectum.
• Stage IV anal cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes
within the abdomen or to distant organs.
Treatment
Anal cancer is treated using three methods, used
either in concert or individually: surgery,radiation ther-
apy, and chemotherapy.
Two types of surgery may be performed. A local
resection, performed if the cancer has not spread,
removes the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor.
An abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce-
dure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed,
and an opening called a colostomyis created for body
wastes to exit. This procedure is fairly uncommon today
because radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective.
Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to fight
cancer cells. It is usually delivered via a machine outside
the body, but may also be delivered via surgically
implanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is called
internal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation.
Side effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam-
age resembling sunburn, and damage to anal tissues.
Chemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which may
be delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy types
kill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly by
making cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. The
main drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-
FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects of
chemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition to
cancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting, hair
loss, loss of appetite,diarrhea, mouth sores,fatigue,
shortness of breath, and a weakened immune system.
Alternative treatment
Research suggests acupuncturecan help manage
chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and control
pain associated with surgery.
Prognosis
Anal cancer is often curable. The chance of recovery
depends on the cancer stage and the patient’s general health.
KEY TERMS
Biopsy—A procedure in which a small piece of
body tissue is removed and examined under a
microscope for cancer.
Chemotherapy—A cancer treatment in which
drugs delivered into the blood stream kill cancer
cells or make them more vulnerable to radiation
therapy.

Anal warts
Definition
Anal warts, also known as condyloma acuminata,
are small warts that can occur in the rectum.
Description
Initially appear as tiny blemishes that can be as
small as the head of a pin or grow into larger cauliflower-
like protuberances. They can be yellow, pink, or light
brown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-
able. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware that
they exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.
Most individuals have between one to 10 genital
wartsthtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm
2
. Some
will complain of painless bumps or itching, but often,
these warts can remain completely unnoticed.
Causes and symptoms
Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common
sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.
Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.
Risk factors include smoking, using oral contracep-
tives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital
age. In addition, individuals who have a history of
immunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.
Roughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the
human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which are
the least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-
cerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through direct
sexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-
loma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, including
the penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly
75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-	one infected with condyloma acuminata will develop	these warts within three months.
Treatment
According to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,
including anal warts, should be conducted according to
the methods preferred by the patient, the medications or
procedures most readily available, and the experience of
the patient’s physician in removing anal warts.
Treatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-
cal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the anal
canal will almost always be treated with cauterization or
surgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-
sion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrence
rates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure rates
range from 63–91%.
Unfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-
ments because the virus that causes the warts can live in
the surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal and
wart-free for six months or longer before another wart
develops.
Laser surgeryis another possibility, but requires
local, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on the
number warts and where they are.
Electrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical
energy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful of
the procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminata
of the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It is
done with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge or
bleeding from the anus.
Follow-up visits to the physician are necessary to
make sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-
mended that these patients see their physicians every
three to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how long
the incubation period is for the HPV virus.
Carbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-
tion are other options, but these are usually reserved for
extensive warts or those that continue to recur despite
numerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can
be transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,
they are usually reserved for the worst infections.
For small warts that affect only the skin around the
anus, several medications are available, which can be
applied directly to the surface of the warts by a physician
or by the patients themselves.
Such medications include podophyllum resin
(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from the
cytotoxic extracts of several plants. This agent offers a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2172
Anal warts
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 172  cure rate of 20–50% when used alone, and is applied by
the physician weekly and then washed off 6 hours later
by the patient.
Podofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is avail-
able for patients to use at home. It can be applied twice
daily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly higher
cure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre-
vent warts.
Trichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-
able in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-
ment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau-
terize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, they
cause less irritation and overall body effects than the
other agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, is
higher with these acids.
Bleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option,
but it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis-
tered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but is
can have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol-
lowed carefully by their physician.
Imiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients to
apply themselves. It is to be applied three times weekly,
for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to clear warts
within eight to 10 weeks.
Finally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally
occurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumor
effects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2a
and 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected into
each lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks.
Prognosis
Once a diagnosis of anal warts has been made, fur-
ther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes prevented
with proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of anal warts
either fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients have
to undergo roughly six to nine treatments over several
months to assure that the warts are completely eradicated.
Recurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50%
after one year and may be due to the long incubation of
HPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,
virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.
Prevention
Sexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can
be the most effective form of prevention, and condoms
may also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo-
ma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual relations with peo-
ple who have anal or genital warts can prevent infection.
Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware that
they have this condition, this is not always possible.
KEY TERMS
Electrocoagulation—a technique using electrical
energy to destroy the warts. Usually done for warts
within the anus with a local anesthesia, electroco-
agulation is most painful form of therapy, and can
cause both bleeding and discharge from the anus.
Individuals infected with anal warts should have fol-
low-up checkups every few weeks after their initial treat-
ment, after which self-exams can be done.
Sexual partners of people who have anal warts
should also be examined, as a precautionary preventive
measure.
Finally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex)
may be useful to prevent recurrence once the warts have
been removed. Treatment must, however, be initiated
within 1 month of wart removal.

Analgesics
Definition
Analgesics are medicines that relieve pain.
Purpose
Analgesics are those drugs whose primary purpose
is pain relief. The primary classes of analgesics are the
narcotics, including additional agents that are chemically
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	173
Analgesics
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 173  based on the morphine molecule but have minimal abuse
potential; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) including the salicylates; and
acetaminophen. Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-
depressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,
have been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic
pain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-
gesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on
causation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of
their dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.
Description
Pain has been classified as “productive” pain and
“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has no
physiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-
ment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warning
of injury, and so may be both an indication of need for
treatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”
pain by definition serves no purpose either as a warning
or diagnostic tool.
Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the
common factor is a sensory pathway from the affected
organ to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the
nerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheral
nervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by the
central nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-
gesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors
of each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity of
pain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain has
been divided into two classes, acute and chronic,
although severity and projected patient survival are other
factors that must be considered in drug selection.
Acute pain
Acute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes
post-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth.
Because pain of these types is expected to be short term,
the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-
tinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely be
treated with narcotic analgesics without concern for their
addictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concern
for their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should be
adjusted based on observation of healing rate, switching
patients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-
gesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.
An important consideration of pain managementin
severe pain is that patients should not be subject to the
return of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately to
assure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequently
enough to avoid the anxietythat accompanies the antici-
pated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed on
a “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered often
enough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This
applies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.
Chronic pain
Chronic pain, pain lasting over three months and
severe enough to impair function, is more difficult to
treat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics
are more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-
gesics this means the addictionpotential, as well as res-
piratory depression and constipation. For the NSAIDs,
the risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. While
some classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-
onist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,
and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-
coxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,
they are still not fully suitable for long-term management
of severe pain. Generally, chronic pain management
requires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-
cation, and other treatment modalities.
Narcotic analgesics
The narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all
derived from opium. The class includes morphine,
codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including
meperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-
ers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all are
effective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-
quate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Because
these drugs are all addictive, they are controlled under
federal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms are
available, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous and
intrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.
NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are
effective analgesics even at doses too low to have any
anti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-
cal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects and
side effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-
tration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate for
injection and may be used in moderate to severe pain for
short periods.
Acetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no
anti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild to
moderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-
mal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.
Because acetaminophen is largely free of side effects at
therapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choice
for mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis.
Recommended dosage
Appropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-
sider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2174
Analgesics
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174  with patient age and condition. For example, narcotic
analgesics should usually be avoided in patients with a
history of substance abuse, but may be fully appropriate
in patients with cancerpain. Similarly, because narcotics
are more rapidly metabolized in patients who have used
these drugs for a long period, higher than normal doses
may be needed to provide adequate pain management.
NSAIDs, although comparatively safe in adults, repre-
sent an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in
patients over the age of 60.
Precautions
Narcotic analgesics may be contraindicated in
patients with respiratory depression. NSAIDS may be
hazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer history.
They should be used with care in patients with renal
insufficiency or coagulation disorders. NSAIDs are
contraindicated in patients allergic to aspirin.
Side effects
Review adverse effects of each drug individually.
Drugs within a class may vary in their frequency and
severity of adverse effects.
The primary adverse effects of the narcotic anal-
gesics are addiction, constipation, and respiratory
depression. Because narcotic analgesics stimulate the
production of enzymes that cause the metabolism of
these drugs, patients on narcotics for a prolonged period
may require increasing doses. This is not the same thing
as addiction, and is not a reason for withholding medica-
tion from patients in severe pain.
NSAIDs are ulcerogenic and may cause kidney
problems. Gastrointestinal discomfort is common,
although in some cases, these drugs may cause ulcers

Analgesics, opioid
Definition
Opioid analgesics, also known as narcotic anal-
gesics, are painrelievers that act on the central nervous
system. Like all narcotics, they may become habit-form-
ing if used over long periods.
Purpose
Opioid analgesics are used to relieve pain from a
variety of conditions. Some are used before or during
surgery (including dental surgery) both to relieve pain and
to make anesthetics work more effectively. They may also
be used for the same purposes during labor and delivery.
Description
Opioid analgesics relieve pain by acting directly on
the central nervous system. However, this can also lead
to unwanted side effects, such as drowsiness,dizziness,
breathing problems, and physical or mental dependence.
Among the drugs in this category are codeine, pro-
poxyphene (Darvon), propoxyphene and acetaminophen
(Darvocet N), meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone
(Dilaudid), morphine, oxycodone, oxycodone and aceta-
minophen (Percocet, Roxicet), and hydrocodone and
acetaminophen (Lortab, Anexsia). These drugs come in
many forms—tablets, syrups, suppositories, and injec-
tions, and are sold only by prescription. For some, a new
prescription is required for each new supply—refills are
prohibited according to federal regulations.
Recommended dosage
Recommended doses vary, depending on the type of
opioid analgesic and the form in which it is being used.
Doses may be different for different patients. Check with
the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	175
Analgesics, opioid
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 175  who filled the prescription for correct dosages, and make
sure to understand how to take the drug.
Always take opioid analgesics exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take
the drug for longer than directed. Do not stop taking the
drug suddenly without checking with the physician or
dentist who prescribed it. Gradually tapering the dose
may the chance of withdrawal symptoms.
Precautions
Anyone who uses opioid analgesics—or any narcot-
ic—over a long time may become physically or mentally
dependent on the drug. Physical dependence may lead to
withdrawal symptoms when the person stops taking the
medicine. Building tolerance to these drugs is also possi-
ble when they are used for a long period. Over time, the
body needs larger and larger doses to relieve pain.
Take these drugs exactly as directed. Never take
more than the recommended dose, and do not take the
drugs more often than directed. If the drugs do not seem
to be working, consult your physician. Do not share these
or any other prescription drugs with others because the
drug may have a completely different effect on the per-
son for whom it was not prescribed.
Children and older people are especially sensitive to
opioid analgesics and may have serious breathing prob-

unusually restless or agitated when given these drugs.
Opioid analgesics increase the effects of alcohol.
Anyone taking these drugs should not drink alcoholic
beverages.
Some of these drugs may also contain aspirin,caf-
feine, or acetaminophen. Refer to the entries on each of
these drugs for additional precautions.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take opioid analgesics. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions.
ALLERGIES.Let the physician know about any aller-
giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances
and about any previous reactions to opioid analgesics.
PREGNANCY.Women who are pregnant or plan to
become pregnant while taking opioid analgesics should
let their physicians know. No evidence exists that these
drugs cause birth defectsin people, but some do cause
birth defects and other problems when given to pregnant
animals in experiments. Babies can become dependent
on opioid analgesics if their mothers use too much during
pregnancy. This can cause the baby to go through with-
drawal symptoms after birth. If taken just before deliv-
ery, some opioid analgesics may cause serious breathing
problems in the newborn.
BREAST FEEDING.Some opioid analgesics can pass
into breast milk. Women who are breast feeding should
check with their physicians about the safety of taking
these drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. These conditions
may influence the effects of opioid analgesics:
• head injury. The effects of some opioid analgesics may
be stronger and may interfere with recovery in people
with head injuries.
• history of convulsions. Some of these drugs may trigger
convulsions.
• asthma,emphysema, or any chronic lung disease
• heart disease
• kidney disease
• liver disease
• underactive thyroid. The chance of side effects may be
greater.
• addison’s disease (a disease of the adrenal glands)
• colitis
• gallbladder disease or gallstones. Side effects can be
dangerous in people with these conditions.
• enlarged prostate or other urinary problems
• current or past alcohol abuse
• current or past drug abuse, especially narcotic abuse
• current or past emotional problems. The chance of side
effects may be greater.
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking opioid nar-
cotics with certain other drugs may increase the chances
of serious side effects.
Side effects
Some people experience drowsiness, dizziness, light-
headedness, or a false sense of well-being after taking opi-
oid analgesics. Anyone who takes these drugs should not
drive, use machines, or do anything else that might be dan-
gerous until they know how the drug affects them. Nausea
and vomitingare common side effects, especially when
first beginning to take the medicine. If these symptoms do
not go away after the first few doses, check with the physi-
cian or dentist who prescribed the medicine.
Dry mouthis another common side effect. Dry
mouth can be relieved by sucking on sugarless hard
candy or ice chips or by chewing sugarless gum. Saliva
substitutes, which come in liquid or tablet forms, also
may help. Patients who must use opioid analgesics over
long periods and who have dry mouth should see their
dentists, as the problem can lead to tooth decayand
other dental problems.
The following side effects are less common. They
usually do not need medical attention and will go away
after the first few doses. If they continue or interfere with
normal activity, check with the physician who prescribed
the medicine.
• headache
• loss of appetite
• restlessness or nervousness
• nightmares, unusual dreams, or problems sleeping
• weakness or tiredness
• mental sluggishness
• stomach pain or cramps
• blurred or double vision or other vision problems
• problems urinating, such as pain, difficulty urinating,
frequent urge to urinate, or decreased amount of urine
• constipation.
Other side effects may be more serious and may
require quick medical attention. These symptoms could

immediately.
• cold, clammy skin
• bluish discoloration of the skin
• extremely small pupils
• serious difficulty breathing or extremely slow breathing
• extreme sleepiness or unresponsiveness
• severe weakness
• confusion
• severe dizziness
• severe drowsiness
• slow heartbeat
• low blood pressure
• severe nervousness or restlessness
In addition, these less common side effects do not
require emergency medical care, but should have medical
attention as soon as possible:
•hallucinationsor a sense of unreality
• depression or other mood changes
• ringing or buzzing in the ears
• pounding or unusually fast heartbeat
• itching,hives, or rash
• facial swelling
• trembling or twitching
• dark urine, pale stools, or yellow eyes or skin (after tak-
ing propoxyphene)
• increased sweating, red or flushed face (more common
after taking hydrocodone and meperidine)
Interactions
Anyone taking these drugs should notify his or her
physician before taking opioid analgesics:
• Central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as anti-
histaminesand other medicines for allergies, hay fever,
or colds; tranquilizers; some other prescription pain
relievers; seizure medicines; muscle relaxants; sleeping
pills; some anesthetics (including dental anesthetics).
• Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, such as phenel-
zine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). The com-
bination of the opioid analgesic meperidine (Demerol)
and MAO inhibitors is especially dangerous.
• Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil).
• Anti-seizure medicines, such as carbamazepine (Tegre-
tol). May lead to serious side effects, including coma,
when combined with propoxyphene and acetaminophen
(Darvocet-N) or propoxyphene (Darvon).

Anaphylaxis
Definition
Anaphylaxis is a rapidly progressing, life-threaten-
ing allergic reaction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2178
Anaphylaxis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 178  Description
Anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in which
the immune system responds to otherwise harmless sub-
stances from the environment. Unlike other allergic
reactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction may
begin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, and
rapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin and
intestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severe
cases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,
shock, and death.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Like the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-
laxis is caused by the release of histamine and other
chemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of white
blood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-
sues that regulate exchange with the environment: the
airways, digestive system, and skin.
On their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies
called IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies
are designed to detect environmental substances to
which the immune system is sensitive. Substances from
a genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria or
viruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-
ple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergic
response, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodies
bind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to release
histamine and other chemicals, which spill out onto
neighboring cells.
The interaction of these chemicals with receptors on
the surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leak
fluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-
tion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cells
of the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-
tion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity and
cause itching.
In anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to
extreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually
systemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause
anaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-
latory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-
tion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-
laxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over time
from less severe allergies.
Anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,
drugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:
• fish, shellfish, and mollusks
• nuts and seeds
• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets
• papain from meat tenderizers
• vaccines, including flu and measlesvaccines
• penicillin
• cephalosporins
• streptomycin
• gamma globulin
• insulin
• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)
•aspirinand other NSAIDs
• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for example
Exposure to cold or exercisecan trigger anaphylaxis
in some individuals.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
• urticaria (hives)
• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth
• swelling of the sinuses
• difficulty breathing
• wheezing
• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea
• anxiety or confusion
• strong, very rapid heartbeat (palpitations)
• loss of consciousness
Not all symptoms may be present.
Diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-
opment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.
Identification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-
ing, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specific
allergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-
phylactic reactions.
Treatment
Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-
tion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts blood
vessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygen
may be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.
Antihistaminesmay be used for skin rash, and amino-
phylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway is
obstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-
my tube may be needed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	179
Anaphylaxis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179  Prognosis
The rapidity of symptom development is an indica-
tion of the likely severity of reaction: the faster symp-
toms develop, the more severe the ultimate reaction.
Prompt emergency medical attention and close monitor-
ing reduces the likelihood of death. Nonetheless, death is
possible from severe anaphylaxis. For most people who
receive rapid treatment, recovery is complete.
Prevention
Avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable
method of preventing anaphylaxis. For insect allergies,
this requires recognizing likely nest sites. Preventing food
allergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods or
dishes in which the allergen is likely to occur, and careful
questioning about ingredients when dining out. Use of a
Medic-Alert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to prevent
inadvertent administration during a medical emergency.
People prone to anaphylaxis should carry an “Epi-
pen” or “Ana-kit,” which contain an adrenaline dose
ready for injection.

Anemias
Definition
Anemia is a condition characterized by abnormally
low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin (the
component of red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tis-
sues throughout the body).
Description
The tissues of the human body need a regular supply
of oxygen to stay healthy. Red blood cells, which contain
hemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughout
the body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, the
iron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and used
to create new red blood cells. Anemia develops when
heavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-
thing happens to slow down the production of red blood
cells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.
Types of anemia
Anemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to
lead to life-threatening complications. More than 400
different types of anemia have been identified. Many of
them are rare.
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-
miais the most common form of anemia in the world. In
the United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about
240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and
3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition is
less common in older children and in adults over 50 and
rarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.
The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,
at first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiency
begins when the body loses more iron than it derives
from food and other sources. Because depleted iron
stores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer red
blood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the red
blood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.
Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiency
by producing more red blood cells, which are character-
istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.
FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-
ciency anemiais the most common type of megaloblas-
tic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-
mal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, a vitamin
that the body needs to produce normal cells.
Folic acid anemia is especially common in infants
and teenagers. Although this condition usually results
from a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inability
to absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2180
Anemias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180  • cheese
• eggs
• fish
• green vegetables
• meat
• milk
• mushrooms
• yeast
Smokingraises the risk of developing this condition
by interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C, which the
body needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid anemia can be
a complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s body
needs eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.
VITAMIN B
12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA.Less common in
this country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B
12deficien-
cy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia that
develops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of this
nutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B
12
is found in meat and vegetables.
Large amounts of B
12are stored in the body, so this
condition may not become apparent until as much as four
years after B
12absorption stops or slows down. The
resulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:
• loss of muscle control
• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet
• soreness or burning of the tongue
• weight loss
• yellow-blue color blindness
The most common form of B
12deficiency is perni-
cious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggs
get enough B
12in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin
usually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.
This can occur among people who have had intestinal
surgery or among those who do not produce adequate
amounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by the
stomach lining that combines with B
12to help its absorp-
tion in the small intestine.
Pernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages
of 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-
es the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:
• diabetes mellitus
•gastritis,stomach cancer, or stomach surgery
• thyroid disease
• family history of pernicious anemia
VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder
that causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormally
small red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia
results from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with
hemolytic anemia. Some acquire this condition, in
which infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells
more rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.
Hemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-
ing the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Other
complications of hemolytic anemia include:
•pain
• shock
• gallstones and other serious health problems
THALASSEMIAS.An inherited form of hemolytic
anemia,thalassemiastems from the body’s inability to
manufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.
There are two categories of thalassemia, depending on
which of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobin
is composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-
lassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of the
alpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there is
an imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most
commonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);
beta-thalassemias most commonly affect people of
Mediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.
Characterized by production of red blood cells that
are unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affects
people who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-
somal recessive inheritance).
AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-
body hemolytic anemia is the most common type of this
disorder. This condition occurs when the body produces
autoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cells
are destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.
Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common
in women than in men. About one-third of patients who
have warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-
phoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.
In cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks
red blood cells at or below normal body temperature. The
acute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-
ple who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or other
acute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, and
disappears without treatment.
Chronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most
common in women and most often affects those who are
over 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usually
lasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.
However, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate

Anemias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181  red blood cell destruction, causing fatigue, joint aches,
and discoloration of the arms and hands.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA.Sickle cell anemia is a chron-
ic, incurable condition that causes the body to produce
defective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells to
assume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal oval
cells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobin
to nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes it
hard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-
sels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-
ing condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.
Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always
affects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A
child who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent
will have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cell
gene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, but
does not have the disease.
APLASTIC ANEMIA.Sometimes curable by bone
marrow transplant, but potentially fatal,aplastic anemia
is characterized by decreased production of red and
white blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells that
allow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inherited
or acquired as a result of:
• recent severe illness
• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals
• use of anticancer drugsand certain other medications
ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic
infection or inflammation, and kidney and liver disease
often cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-
ure generally produces the most severe symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Anemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood
cell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.
Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and iron
deficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells are
produced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases can
cause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-
sive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, and
the speed with which blood loss occurs has a significant
effect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss is
usually a consequence of:
• cancer
• gastrointestinal tumors
• diverticulosis
• polyposis
• heavy menstrual flow
• hemorrhoids
• nosebleeds
• stomach ulcers
• long-standing alcohol abuse
Acute blood loss is usually the result of:
• childbirth
• injury
• a ruptured blood vessel
• surgery
When a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood
pressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-
denly. Heart failureand deathcan follow.
Loss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in
the space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual blood
loss is less serious, because the body has time to create
new red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.
Symptoms
Weakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be
signs of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lack
of color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, or
lining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someone
who is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feels
faint or dizzy may be severely anemic.
Other symptoms of anemia are:
• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a
chokingsensation that provokes severe anxiety)
• cravings for ice, paint, or dirt
• headache
• inability to concentrate, memory loss
• inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis) or tongue
(glossitis)
• insomnia
• irregular heartbeat
• loss of appetite
• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged
• rapid breathing
• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum
• sweating
• swelling of the hands and feet
• thirst
• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
• unexplained bleeding or bruising
In pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually
slick. A patient with pernicious anemia may have:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2182
Anemias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 182  • problems with movement or balance
• tingling in the hands and feet
• confusion, depression, and memory loss
Pernicious anemia can damage the spinal cord. A
doctor should be notified whenever symptoms of this
condition occur.
A doctor should also be notified if a patient who has
been taking iron supplements develops:
• diarrhea
• cramps
• vomiting
Diagnosis
Personal and family health history may suggest the
presence of certain types of anemia. Laboratory tests that
measure the percentage of red blood cells or the amount
of hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosis
and determine which type of anemia is responsible for a
patient’s symptoms. X rays and examinations of bone
marrow may be used to identify the source of bleeding.
Treatment
Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usually
be treated at home with iron supplements or self adminis-
tered injections of vitamin B
12. People with folic acid
anemia should take oral folic acid replacements. Vitamin
C deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitamin
C tablet a day.
Surgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused by
excessive loss of blood. Transfusions of red blood cells
may be used to accelerate production of red blood cells.
Medication or surgery may also be necessary to con-
trol heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer, or
remove polyps (growths or nodules) from the bowels.
Patients with thalassemia usually do not require
treatment. However people with a severe form may
require periodic hospitalization for blood transfusions
and/or bone marrow transplantation.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA.Treatment for sickle cell ane-
mia involves regular eye examinations, immunizations
for pneumonia and infectious diseases, and prompt treat-
ment for sickle cell crises and infections of any kind.
Psychotherapy or counseling may help patients deal with
the emotional impact of this condition.
VITAMIN B
12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA.A life-long regi-
men of B
12shots is necessary to control symptoms of per-
nicious anemia. The patient may be advised to limit phys-
ical activity until treatment restores strength and balance.
APLASTIC ANEMIA.People who have aplastic ane-
mia are especially susceptible to infection. Treatment for
aplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bone
marrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells with
healthy ones.
ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specific
treatment for anemia associated with chronic disease, but
treating the underlying illness may alleviate this condi-
tion. This type of anemia rarely becomes severe. If it
does, transfusions or hormone treatments to stimulate red
blood cell production may be prescribed.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.There is no specific treatment
for cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About one-third of
patients with warm-antibody hemolytic anemia respond
well to large doses of intravenous and oral corticos-
teroids, which are gradually discontinued as the patient’s
condition improves. Patients with this condition who
don’t respond to medical therapy must have the spleen
surgically removed. This operation controls anemia in
about half of the patients on whom it’s performed.
Immune-system suppressants are prescribed for patients
whose surgery is not successful.
Self-care
Anyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition
should modify his or her diet to include more vitamins,
minerals, and iron. Vitamin C can stimulate iron absorp-
tion. The following foods are also good sources of iron:
• almonds
• broccoli

• dried fruits
• enriched breads and cereals
• lean red meat
•liver
• potatoes
• poultry
• rice
• shellfish
• tomatoes
Because light and heat destroy folic acid, fruits and
vegetables should be eaten raw or cooked as little as pos-
sible.
Alternative treatment
As is the case in standard medical treatment, the
cause of the specific anemia will determine the alterna-
tive treatment recommended. If the cause is a deficiency,
for example iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, B
12
deficiency, or vitamin C deficiency, supplementation is
the treatment. For extensive blood loss, the cause should
be identified and corrected. Other types of anemias
should be addressed on a deep healing level with crisis
intervention when necessary.
Many alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane-
mia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or on
techniques to improve circulation and digestion. Iron
supplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likely
to cause constipation), is used by alternative practition-
ers. This can be given in combination with herbs that are
rich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-
lion (Taraxacum officinale), parsley (Petroselinum
crispum), and nettle (Urtica dioica). The homeopathic
remedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.
An iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using
the following recipe:
• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion
root in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours
• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced
to 1 cup
• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,
mixing well
• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily
Other herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency
anemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian (Gentiana
lutea) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other
nutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-
tian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and
other nutrients more available for absorption. This bitter
herb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholic
extract (tincture).
Other herbs recommended to promote digestion
include:
• anise (Pimpinella anisum)
• caraway (Carum carvi)
• cumin (Cuminum cyminum)
• linden (Tiliaspp.)
• licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)
Traditional Chinese treatments for anemia include:
• acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen
• asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) to restore energy
• dong quai (Angelica sinensis) to control heavy men-
strual bleeding
• a mixture of dong quai and Chinese foxglove(Rehman-
nia glutinosa) to clear a sallow complexion
Prognosis
Folic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias
It usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic
acid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continue
taking supplements for another six months to replenish
iron reserves and should have periodic blood tests to
make sure the bleeding has stopped and the anemia has
not recurred.
Pernicious anemia
Although pernicious anemia is considered incurable,
regular B
12shots will alleviate symptoms and reverse
complications. Some symptoms will disappear almost as
soon as treatment begins.
Aplastic anemia
Aplastic anemia can sometimes be cured by bone
marrow transplantation. If the condition is due to
immunosuppressive drugs, symptoms may disappear
after the drugs are discontinued.
Sickle cell anemia
Although sickle cell anemia cannot be cured, effec-
tive treatments enable patients with this disease to enjoy
longer, more productive lives.
Thalassemia
People with mild thalassemia (alpha thalassemia
trait or beta thalassemia minor) lead normal lives and do
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2184
Anemias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 184  not require treatment. Those with severe thalassemia
may require bone marrow transplantation. Genetic thera-
py is is being investigated and may soon be available.
Hemolytic anemia
Acquired hemolytic anemia can generally be cured
when the cause is removed.
Prevention
Inherited anemias cannot be prevented. Genetic
counselingcan help parents cope with questions and
concerns about transmitting disease-causing genes to
their children.
Avoiding excessive use of alcohol, eating a balanced
diet that contains plenty of iron-rich foods, and taking a
daily multivitamin can help prevent anemia.
Methods of preventing specific types of anemia
include:
• avoiding lengthy exposure to industrial chemicals and
drugs known to cause aplastic anemia
• not taking medication that has triggered hemolytic ane-
mia and not eating foods that have caused hemolysis
(breakdown of red blood cells)
• receiving regular B
12shots to prevent pernicious anemia
resulting from gastritis or stomach surgery

Anesthesia, general
Definition
General anesthesia is the induction of a state of uncon-
sciousness with the absence of painsensation over the
entire body, through the administration of anesthetic drugs.
It is used during certain medical and surgical procedures.
Purpose
General anesthesia has many purposes including:
• pain relief (analgesia)
• blocking memory of the procedure (amnesia)
• producing unconsciousness
• inhibiting normal body reflexes to make surgery safe
and easier to perform
• relaxing the muscles of the body
Description
Anesthesia performed with general anesthetics
occurs in four stages which may or may not be observ-
able because they can occur very rapidly:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	185
Anesthesia, general
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 185  • Stage One: Analgesia. The patient experiences analge-
sia or a loss of pain sensation but remains conscious
and can carry on a conversation.
• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience
deliriumor become violent. Blood pressure rises and
becomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. This
stage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-
rate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.
• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the
skeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathing
becomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, and
surgery can begin.
• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis. This stage occurs if
the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of the
brain that control breathing and other vital functions
cease to function. Deathcan result if the patient cannot
be revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.
Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-
tered prevent this occurrence.
Agents used for general anesthesia may be either
gases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaled
with oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-
nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugs
are usually delivered during general anesthesia; this
practice is called balanced anesthesia and is used because
it takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-
thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, the
extent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a general
anesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-
centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathed
by the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by an
intravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot be
changed as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-
thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia and
then followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.
General anesthesia works by altering the flow of
sodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through the
cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is
not understood since the drug apparently does not bind to
any receptor on the cell surface and does not seem to
affect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve
impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is
known, however, that when the sodium molecules do not
get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generated
and the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-
ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas of
the body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.
Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not the
same. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up while
others slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-
sciousness is more widespread.
When general anesthesia was first introduced in
medical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled with
the physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.
Since then, general anesthesia has become much more
sophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-
ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-
ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoring
as well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-
gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery of
anesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-
thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-
rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.
• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can
easily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-
sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used with
other agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxic
to the liver in adults, causing death. It also has the
potential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.
Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently the
anesthetic of choice for use with children, but since the
introduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothane
use has declined.
• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a
more rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening
than halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of
paralyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to
increase intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;
therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with
seizure disorders.
• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can
cause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often
used in combination with intravenous anesthetics for
anesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is
faster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.
• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and
should not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-
sis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-
mias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation
during induction and is therefore used with intravenous
anesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-
nated and awakening is therefore faster than with other
inhaled agents.
• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart
rate and should not be used in patients with narrowed
aortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usually
cause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-
rane does not cause any coughing or other related side
effects, and can therefore be used without intravenous
agents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluorane
is replacing halothane for induction in pediatric
patients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-
nated and allows rapid awakening.

used with other agents, such as thiopental, to produce
surgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction and
recovery and is the safest because it does not slow
breathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-
es rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in a
collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or lower the oxygen
contents of tissues (hypoxia).
Commonly administered intravenous anesthetic
agents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.
• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a
dissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia)
in which the patient may appear awake and reactive, but
cannot respond to sensory stimuli. These properties
make it especially useful for use in developing coun-
tries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine is
frequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesia
and analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscular
injection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patients
and in shockcases, because it also provides cardiac
stimulation.
• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a
rapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-
tal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-
tion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuously
infused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting
upon awakening.
• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and
are frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a
sedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion
for primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affect
the cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful
for cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioids
act directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently
used in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects may
include nausea and vomiting,itching, and respiratory
depression.
• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent
and the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.
Its rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-
tical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quickly
and with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-
fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in
the urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-
thesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidly
replacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.
It is used for general surgery, cardiac surgery, neuro-
surgery, and pediatric surgery.
General anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-
gists, the medical professionals trained to use them. These
specialists consider many factors, including a patient’s
age, weight, medication allergies, medical history, and
general health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-
nation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-
ly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injected
into a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.
General anesthesia is much safer today than it was in
the past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,
improved safety standards in the equipment used to
deliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-
ing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity during
surgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.
Recommended dosage
The dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the
patient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgery
or medical procedure being done, and other medication
the patient takes before, during, or after surgery.
Precautions
Although the risks of serious complications from
general anesthesia are very low, they can include heart
attack,stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-
uled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughly
discuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risks
of complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,
weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking,
drinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can be
minimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-
ologist are fully informed of the detailed health condition
of the patient, including any drugs that he or she may be
using. Older people are especially sensitive to the effects
of certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-
ence side effects from these drugs.
Patients who have had general anesthesia should not
drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slow
down the central nervous system (such as antihista-
mines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain
relievers,muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication)
for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions are at greater
risk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before
undergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow-
ing conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had allergic or other
unusual reactions to barbituratesor general anesthetics
in the past should notify the doctor before having general
anesthesia. In particular, people who have had malignant
hyperthermia or whose family members have had malig-
nant hyperthermia during or after being given an anes-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	187
Anesthesia, general
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 187  thetic should inform the physician. Signs of malignant
hyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-
ing problems, very high fever, and muscle tightness or
spasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-
istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-
cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also be
told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or
other substances.
PREGNANCY.The effects of anesthetics on pregnant
women and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. In
general, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to the
mother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-
gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the use
of anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.
Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia for
other medical procedures should ensure that the treating
physician is informed about the pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING.Some general anesthetics pass into
breast milk, but they have not been reported to cause prob-
lems in nursing babies whose mothers were given the drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before being given
a general anesthetic, a patient who has any of the follow-
ing conditions should inform his or her doctor:
• neurological conditions, such as epilepsy or stroke
• problems with the stomach or esophagus, such as ulcers
or heartburn
• eating disorders
• loose teeth, dentures, bridgework
• heart disease or family history of heart problems
• lung diseases, such as emphysemaor asthma
• history of smoking
• immune system diseases
• arthritis or any other conditions that affect movement
• diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes or
thyroid problems
Side effects
Because general anesthetics affect the central ner-
vous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tired
for as long as a few days after having general anesthesia.
Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination prob-
lems are also possible. For these reasons, anyone who
has had general anesthesia should not drive, operate
machinery, or perform other activities that could endan-
ger themselves or others for at least 24 hours, or longer
if necessary.
Most side effects usually disappear as the anesthetic
wears off. A nurse or doctor should be notified if these or
other side effects persist or cause problems, such as:
•Headache
• vision problems, including blurred or double vision
• shivering or trembling
• muscle pain
• dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness
• drowsiness
• mood or mental changes
• nausea or vomiting
• sore throat
• nightmares or unusual dreams
A doctor should be notified as soon as possible if
any of the following side effects occur within two weeks
of having general anesthesia:
• severe headache
• pain in the stomach or abdomen
• back or leg pain
• severe nausea
• black or bloody vomit
• unusual tiredness or weakness
• weakness in the wrist and fingers
• weight loss or loss of appetite

Interactions
General anesthetics may interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may be altered or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Anyone scheduled to undergo general anes-
thesia should inform the doctor about all other medica-
tion that he or she is taking. This includes prescription
drugs, nonprescription medicines, and street drugs. Seri-
ous and possibly life-threatening reactions may occur
when general anesthetics are given to people who use
street drugs, such as cocaine, marijuana, phencyclidine
(PCP or angel dust), amphetamines (uppers), barbiturates
(downers), heroin, or other narcotics. Anyone who uses
these drugs should make sure their doctor or dentist
knows what they have taken.

Anesthesia, local
Definition
Local or regional anesthesia involves the injection or
application of an anesthetic drug to a specific area of the
body, as opposed to the entire body and brain as occurs
during general anesthesia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	189
Anesthesia, local
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 189  Purpose
Local anesthetics are used to prevent patients from
feeling painduring medical, surgical, or dental proce-
dures. Over-the-counter local anesthetics are also avail-
able to provide temporary relief from pain, irritation, and
itchingcaused by various conditions, such as cold sores,
canker sores, sore throats,sunburn, insect bites, poison
ivy, and minor cuts and scratches.
Types of surgery or medical procedures that regular-
ly make use of local or regional anesthesia include the
following:
• biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for
diagnostic procedures
• childbirth
• surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet
• eye surgery
• surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs
Surgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu-
ally performed under general anesthesia.
Local and regional anesthesia have advantages over
general anesthesia in that patients can avoid some
unpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting pain
relief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a sense of
psychological comfort by not losing consciousness.
Description
Regional anesthesia typically affects a larger area than
local anesthesia, for example, everything below the waist.
As a result, regional anesthesia may be used for more
involved or complicated surgical or medical procedures.
Regional anesthetics are injected. Local anesthesia involves
the injection into the skin or muscle or application to the
skin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Local
anesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi-
cal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic.
Local and regional anesthesia work by altering the
flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neurons
through the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic
does this is not understood, since the drug apparently
does not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and does
not seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmit
nerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.
It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules do
not get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat-
ed and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. The
duration of action of an anesthetic depends on the type
and amount of anesthetic administered.
Regional anesthesia
Types of regional anesthesia include:
• Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec-
tion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly into
the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (the
subarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com-
mon but are easily treated.
• Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves the
injection of a large volume of local anesthetic directly
into the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (the
epidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain relief
occurs more slowly but is less likely to produce blood
pressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained for
long periods, even days.
• Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of an
anesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies a
particular region of the body, preventing the nerve from
carrying nerve impulses to the brain.
Anesthetics may be administered with another drug,
such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed-
ing, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of a
drug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may be
administered to help a patient remain calm and more
comfortable or to make them sleepy.
Local anesthesia
INJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS.These medicines
are given by injection to numb and provide pain relief to
some part of the body during surgery, dental procedures,
or other medical procedures. They are given only by a
trained health care professional and only in a doctor’s
office or a hospital. Some commonly used injectable
local anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine
(Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine,
and other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine).
TOPICAL ANESTHETICS.Topical anesthetics, such as
benzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben,
and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening the
nerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari-
ety of nonprescription products that are applied to the
skin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites or
stings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns.
These products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays,
lotions, and gels.
DENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some
local anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouth
or throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain,
teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis-
comfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Some
dental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre-
scription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip-
tion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo-
raseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.

Anesthesia, local
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 190  OPHTHALMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anesthetics
are designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic anesthetics
proparacaine and tetracaine are used to numb the eye
before certain eye examinations. Eye doctors may also use
these medicines before measuring eye pressure or remov-
ing stitches or foreign objectsfrom the eye. These drugs
are to be given only by a trained health care professional.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
local anesthetic and the purpose for which it is being
used. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic, fol-
low the directions on the package. Questions concerning
how to use a product should be referred to a medical doc-
tor, dentist, or pharmacist.
Precautions
People who strongly feel that they cannot psycho-
logically cope with being awake and alert during certain
procedures may not be good candidates for local or
regional anesthesia. Other medications may be given in
conjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi-
etyand help the patient relax.
Local anesthetics should be used only for the condi-
tions for which they are intended. For example, a topical
anesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not be
used on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-
tion to any local anesthetic in the past should check with
a doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again.
The doctor should also be told about any allergiesto
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of
local anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen-
sitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older people
who use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe-
cially careful not to use more than the recommended
amount. Children also may be especially sensitive to the
effects of some local anesthetics, which may increase the
chance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on a
child should be careful not to use more than the amount
that is recommended for children. Certain types of local
anesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol-
low package directions carefully and check with a doctor
of pharmacist if there are any questions.
Regional anesthetics
Serious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may
occur when anesthetics are given to people who use
street drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine,marijuana,
amphetamines,barbiturates, phencyclidine (PCP, or
angel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should make
sure their doctor or dentist knows what they have used.
Patients who have had a particular kind of reaction
called malignant hyperthermia (or who have one or more
family members who have had this problem) during or
just after receiving a general anesthetic should inform
their doctors before receiving any kind of anesthetic.
Signs of malignant hyperthermia include fast and irregu-
lar heartbeat, very high fever, breathing problems, and
muscle spasms or tightness.
Although problems are rare, some unwanted side
effects may occur when regional anesthetics are used
during labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolong
labor and increase the risk of Cesarean section. Preg-
nant women should discuss with their doctors the risks
and benefits of being given these drugs.
Patients should not drive or operate other machinery
immediately following a procedure involving regional
anesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if local
anesthesia also included drugs to make the patient sleep
or strong pain medications. Injection sites should be kept
clean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection.
Injectable local anesthetics
Until the anesthetic wears off, patients should be
careful not to injure the numbed area. If the anesthetic
was used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until feel-
ing returns.
Topical anesthetics
Unless advised by a doctor, topical anesthetics
should not be used on or near any part of the body
with large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury,
or infection. They should also not be used on large
areas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcohol
and should not be used near an open flame, or while
smoking.
Anyone using a topical anesthetic should be careful
not to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or mouth.
When using a spray form of this medication, do not spray
it directly on the face, but apply it to the face with a cot-
ton swab or sterile gauze pad. After using a topical anes-
thetic on a child, make sure the child does not get the
medicine in his or her mouth.
Topical anesthetics are intended for the temporary
relief of pain and itching. They should not be used for
more than a few days at a time. Check with a doctor if:
• the discomfort continues for more than seven days
• the problem gets worse
• the treated area becomes infected
• new signs of irritation, such as skin rash, burning, sting-
ing, or swelling appear
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	191
Anesthesia, local
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 191  Dental anesthetics (non-injectable)
Dental anesthetics should not be used if certain
kinds of infections are present. Check package directions
or check with a dentist or medical doctor if uncertain.
Dental anesthetics should be used only for temporary
pain relief. If problems such as toothache, mouth sores,
or pain from dentures or braces continue, check with a
dentist. Check with a doctor if sore throatpain is severe,
lasts more than two days, or is accompanied by other
symptoms such as fever,headache, skin rash, swelling,
nausea, or vomiting.
Patients should not eat or chew gum while the mouth
is numb from a dental anesthetic. There is a risk of acci-
dently biting the tongue or the inside of the mouth. Also
nothing should be eaten or drunk for one hour after
applying a dental anesthetic to the back of the mouth or
throat, since the medicine may interfere with swallowing
and may cause choking. If normal feeling does not
return to the mouth within a few hours after receiving a
dental anesthetic or if it is difficult to open the mouth,
check with a dentist.
Ophthalmic anesthetics
When anesthetics are used in the eye, it is important
not to rub or wipe the eye until the effect of the anesthet-
ic has worn off and feeling has returned. Rubbing the eye
while it is numb could cause injury.
Side effects
Side effects of regional or local anesthetics vary
depending on the type of anesthetic used and the way it is
administered. Anyone who has unusual symptoms fol-
lowing the use of an anesthetic should get in touch with
his or her doctor immediately.
Paralysisafter regional anesthesia, for example an
epidural or spinal block, is extremely rare, but can occur.
Paralysis reportedly occurs even less frequently than
deaths due to general anesthesia.
There is a small risk of developing a severe
headache called a spinal headache following a spinal or
epidural block. This headache is severe when the patient
is upright and hardly felt when the patient lies down.
Though rare, it can occur and can be treated by perform-
ing a blood patch, in which a small amount of the
patient’s own blood is injected into the area in the back
where the anesthetic was injected. The blood clots and
closes up any area that may have been leaking spinal
fluid. Relief is almost immediate. Finally, blood clots or
abscesscan form in the back, but these are also readily
treatable and so pose little risk.
KEY TERMS
Canker sore—A painful sore inside the mouth.
Cold sore—A small blister on the lips or face,
caused by a virus. Also called a fever blister.
Epidural space—The space surrounding the spinal
fluid sac.
Malignant hyperthermia—A type of reaction
(probably with a genetic basis) that can occur dur-
ing general anesthesia in which the patient experi-
ences a high fever, the muscles become rigid, and
the heart rate and blood pressure fluctuate.
Subarachnoid space—The space surrounding the
spinal cord that is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
Topical—Not ingested; applied to the outside of
the body, for example to the skin, eye, or mouth.
A physician should be notified immediately if any of
these symptoms occur:
• large swellings that look like hiveson the skin, in the
mouth, or in the throat
• severe headache
• blurred or double vision
• dizziness or lightheadedness
• drowsiness
• confusion
• anxiety, excitement, nervousness, or restlessness
• convulsions (seizures)
• feeling hot, cold, or numb
• ringing or buzzing in the ears
• shivering or trembling
• sweating
• pale skin
• slow or irregular heartbeat
• breathing problems
• unusual weakness or tiredness
Interactions
Some anesthetic drugs may interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of the
drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who receives a regional or local anesthetic

Aneurysmectomy
Definition
Aneurysmectomy is a surgical procedure performed
to repair a weak area in the aorta. The aorta is the largest
artery in the body and the main blood vessel leading
away from the heart.
Purpose
The purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor-
tic aneurysmthat is likely to rupture if left in place.
Aneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm that
grows to at least 2 in (5 cm) or for an aortic aneurysm of
any size that is symptomatic, tender, or enlarging rapidly.
Precautions
Aneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for
patients with severely debilitating diseases such as can-
cer,emphysema, and heart failure.
Description
An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta
that is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis.
People who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel-
op an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likely
to develop one than women.
An aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It
rarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosed
by accident during a routine physical exam or on an x ray
or ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysm
grows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, which
causes catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aortic
aneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of blood
within minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleeds
that lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak-
ing aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal.
Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two
most common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor-
tic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid-
neys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in the
chest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital under
general anesthesia and involves removing debris and
then implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace the
enlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of the
ascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travels
upward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung
machine that temporarily stops the heart while the
aneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one-
week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.
During surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either the
abdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to expose
the aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below the
aneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision is
made in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn in
place above and below the opened aneurysm, but the
aneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood are
cleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removed
and blood flow is re-established through the graft. The
wall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro-
tect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.
Aneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or
emergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes about
an hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy,
with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominal
aneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracic
aneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% of
patients die before they reach the hospital. Of those who
make it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. After
a successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly the
same life expectancy as other people of the same age.
Preparation
Before elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a
chest x ray, cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram
(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.
Aftercare
After aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored in
an Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours. Follow-
up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound.
Risks
Elective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli-
cations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com-
plications,heart attack,stroke, infection, limb loss, bowel
ischemia, and impotence. These complications are many
times more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.

KEY TERMS
Aneurysm—A weakening in the muscular walls of
a part of the artery which causes the damaged sec-
tion to enlarge or sag, giving it a balloon-like
appearance.
Aorta—The main blood vessel that leads away
from the heart and the body’s largest artery. The
aorta carries blood from the heart through the
chest and abdomen, providing major branches to
all of the organs in the body.
Arteriosclerosis—Hardening of the arteries that
occurs as part of the aging process.
Artery—A blood vessel that carries blood from the
heart to the body’s tissues.
Atherosclerosis—A form of arteriosclerosis in
which cholesterol-containing fatty deposits accu-
mulate in the inner most walls of the heart’s arteries.
Thoracic—Relating to the chest.
Aneurysms seeAneurysmectomy; Cerebral
aneurysm; Ventricular aneurysmAngina
Definition
Angina is pain, “discomfort,” or pressure localized
in the chest that is caused by an insufficient supply of
blood (ischemia) to the heart muscle. It is also some-
times characterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation,
or crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-
na pectoris.
Description
Often described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-
sation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describe
chest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygen
to the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actual
heart attack, but rather pain that results from the heart
muscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-
porary condition may be the result of demanding activi-
ties such as exerciseand does not necessarily indicate
that the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.
In fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-
age to heart muscle.
Angina can be subdivided further into two cate-
gories: angina of effort and variant angina.
Angina of effort
Angina of effort is a common disorder caused by the
narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that supply
oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case of
angina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can provide
the heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood during
rest but not during periods of exercise,stress, or excite-
ment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain is
relieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, a
medication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patients
with angina of effort have an increased risk of heart
attack (myocardial infarction).
Variant angina
Variant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-
dently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be present
as an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest and
is not related to excessive work by the heart muscle.
Research indicates that variant angina is caused by coro-

Angina
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 194  nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or
intensity to cause an actual heart attack.
Causes and symptoms
Angina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-
ness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-
num). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,
neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occur
when the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond the
oxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, the
condition is often precipitated by physical exertion. In
most cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-
utes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-
tions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavy
meals, cigarette smoking, and alcohol can also cause or
contribute to an episode of angina.
Diagnosis
Physicians can usually diagnose angina based on the
patient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-
er, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm or
rule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-
lying heart disease.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical
impulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electrical
activity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioning
properly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-
grams are also useful in investigating other possible
abnormal features of the heart.
Stress test
For many individuals with angina, the results of an
electrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-
malities. Because the symptoms of angina occur during
stress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu-
ated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress test
records information from the electrocardiogram before,
during, and after exercise in search of stress-related
abnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured during
the stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involved
and complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning)
may be used in some cases to picture the blood flow in
the heart muscle during the most intense time of exercise
and after rest.
Angiogram
The angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the
coronary artery, has been noted to be the most accurate
diagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of
coronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexible
tube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located in
the forearm or groin. This catheter is passed further
through the artery into one of the two major coronary
arteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays
“see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief x
rays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowing
through the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos-
sible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow to
the heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.
Treatment
Conservative treatment
Artery disease causing angina is addressed initially by
controlling existing factors placing the individual at risk.
These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high blood
pressure,high cholesterollevels, and obesity. Angina is
often controlled by medication, most commonly with
nitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina by
increasing the diameter of the blood vessels carrying
blood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken whenever
discomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken by
mouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder-
mally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. In
addition,beta blockersor calcium channel blockers
may be prescribed to also decrease the demand on the
heart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart.
Surgical treatment
When conservative treatments are not effective in
the reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attack
remains high, physicians may recommend angioplasty
or surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera-
tion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgically
removed from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked artery
to bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path-
way allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.
Another procedure used to improve blood flow to
the heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the
physician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the end
into a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread-
ed up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat-
ed to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech-
niques using laser and mechanical devices are being
developed and applied, also by means of catheters.
Alternative treatment
During an angina episode, relief has been noted by
applying massage or kinesiological methods, but these
techniques are not standard recommendations by physi-

fingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane-
ously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up and
down its entire length using the other hand. This is fol-
lowed by additional massaging by the fingertip and
thumb next to the sternum, on each side.
Once the angina has subsided, the cause should be
determined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat-
ed cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari-
ly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugar
and saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con-
ventional and alternative medicine agree that increasing
exercise and improving diet are important steps to reduce
high cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro-
posed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev-
eral gaining the attention and interest of the public. One
of the most recent popular treatments is garlic (Allium
sativum). Some studies have shown that adequate dosages
of garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL
(bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles-
terol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significant
benefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as great
as that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be of
benefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with-
out causing the side effects associated with cholesterol-
reducing drugs. Other herbal remedies that may help
lower cholesterol include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenu-
greek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), Asian ginseng
(Panax ginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa).
Antioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),
vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida-
tive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be a
precursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.
Prognosis
The prognosis for a patient with angina depends on
its origin, type, severity, and the general health of the
individual. A person who has angina has the best progno-
sis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learns
the pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes the
attacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usually
last, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat-
terns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp-
toms resemble those of a heart attack, medical help
should be sought immediately.
Prevention
In most cases, the best prevention involves changing
one’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina. If
blood pressure medication has been prescribed, compli-
ance is a necessity and should be a priority as well. Many
healthcare professionals—including physicians, dieti-

Angiography
Definition
Angiography is the x-ray study of the blood vessels.
An angiogram uses a radiopaque substance, or dye, to

Angiography
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 196  make the blood vessels visible under x ray. Arteriography is
a type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries.
Purpose
Angiography is used to detect abnormalities or
blockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)
throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.
The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle-
rosis; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func-
tion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect an
aneurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup-
ture leading to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteri-
ovenous malformations(abnormals tangles of arteries
and veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems with
the retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons an
accurate “map” of the heart prior to open-heart surgery,
or of the brain prior to neurosurgery.
Precautions
Patients with kidney disease or injury may suffer
further kidney damage from the contrast mediums used
for angiography. Patients who have blood clotting prob-
lems, have a known allergy to contrast mediums, or are
allergic to iodine, a component of some contrast medi-
ums, may also not be suitable candidates for an angiogra-
phy procedure. Because x rays carry risks of ionizing
radiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are also
advised to avoid this procedure.
Description
Angiography is usually performed at a hospital by a
trained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse. It
takes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for most
types of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will be
monitored throughout the procedure.
Angiography requires the injection of a contrast dye
that makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye is
injected through a procedure known as arterial puncture.
The puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,
inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep-
tic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, a
small incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.
A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert-
ed through the skin into the artery. When the radiologist
has punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet is
removed and replaced with another long wire called a
guide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee-
dle before the guide wire is inserted.
The guide wire is fed through the outer needle into
the artery and to the area that requires angiographic
study. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the
patient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to the
correct location. Once it is in position, the needle is
removed and a catheter is slid over the length of the
guide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guide
wire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa-
ration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye.
Depending on the type of angiography procedure
being performed, the contrast medium is either injected
by hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected with
an automatic injector connected to the catheter. An
automatic injector is used frequently because it is able
to propel a large volume of dye very quickly to the
angiogram site. The patient is warned that the injection
will start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-
tion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possible
side effects or reactions include headache,dizziness,
irregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation,
and chest pain, but they usually last only momentarily.
To view the area of study from different angles or per-
spectives, the patient may be asked to change positions
several times, and subsequent dye injections may be
administered. During any injection, the patient or the
camera may move.
Throughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic-
tures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) will
be taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial blood
flow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s system
quickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 197  An automatic film changer is used because the manual
changing of x-ray plates can eat up valuable time.
Once the x rays are complete, the catheter is slowly
and carefully removed from the patient. Pressure is
applied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for 10-
20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and the
arterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage is
then applied.
Most angiograms follow the general procedures out-
lined above, but vary slightly depending on the area of
the vascular system being studied. A variety of common
angiography procedures are outlined below:
Cerebral angiography
Cerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,
blood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain.
The catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid artery
and the injected contrast medium travels through the
blood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experience
headache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head or
neck during the injection portion of the procedure. A
cerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete.
Coronary angiography
Coronary angiography is administered by a cardiol-
ogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by a
radiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in the
femoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire and
catheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray series
on the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placed
in the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aortic
valves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view of
the right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul-
monic valves, the catheter will be inserted through a
large vein and guided into the right ventricle. The
catheter also serves the purpose of monitoring blood
pressures in these different locations inside the heart. The
angiogram procedure takes several hours, depending on
the complexity of the procedure.
Pulmonary angiography
Pulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to
evaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid-
ered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul-
monary embolism. The procedure differs from cerebral
and coronary angiograms in that the guide wire and
catheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, and
are guided up through the chambers of the heart and into
the pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, the
patient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that the
catheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias, or irregular heart-
beats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul-
monary artery where it circulates through the lung capil-
laries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes.
Kidney angiography
Patients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf-
fer further damage to their kidneys from the contrast
medium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they often
require the test to evaluate kidney function. These
patients should be well-hydrated with a intravenous
saline drip before the procedure, and may benefit from
available medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro-
tect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents.
During a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheter
are inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area and
advanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery in
the abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedure
will take approximately one hour.
Fluorescein angiography
Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal
problems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con-
ducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupils
are dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore-
head against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodium
fluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a vein
in the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through the
patient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. The
procedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid series
of close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken,
one set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec-
ond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye has
moved through the patient’s vascular system. The entire
procedure takes up to one hour.
Celiac and mesenteric angiography
Celiac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray
exploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterial
branches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to the
abdomen and digestive system. The test is commonly
used to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs of
ischemiain the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to
locate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also
used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ-
ing portal hypertension, and cirrhosis. The procedure
can take up to three hours, depending on the number of
blood vessels studied.
Splenoportography
A splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogram
that involves the injection of contrast medium directly
into the spleen to view the splenic and portal veins. It is
used to diagnose blockages in the splenic vein and portal

the vascular system prior to liver transplantation.
Most angiography procedures are typically paid for by
major medical insurance. Patients should check with their
individual insurance plans to determine their coverage.
Preparation
Patients undergoing an angiogram are advised to
stop eating and drinking eight hours prior to the proce-
dure. They must remove all jewelry before the procedure
and change into a hospital gown. If the arterial puncture
is to be made in the armpit or groin area, shaving may be
required. A sedative may be administered to relax the
patient for the procedure. An IV line will also be inserted
into a vein in the patient’s arm before the procedure
begins in case medication or blood products are required
during the angiogram.
Prior to the angiography procedure, patients will be
briefed on the details of the test, the benefits and risks,
KEY TERMS
Arteriosclerosis—A chronic condition character-
ized by thickening and hardening of the arteries and
the build-up of plaque on the arterial walls. Arte-
riosclerosis can slow or impair blood circulation.
Carotid artery—An artery located in the neck.
Catheter—A long, thin, flexible tube used in angiog-
raphy to inject contrast material into the arteries.
Cirrhosis—A condition characterized by the
destruction of healthy liver tissue. A cirrhotic liver is
scarred and cannot break down the proteins in the
bloodstream. Cirrhosis is associated with portal
hypertension.
Embolism—A blood clot, air bubble, or clot of for-
eign material that travels and blocks the flow of
blood in an artery. When blood supply to a tissue or
organ is blocked by an embolism, infarction, or
death of the tissue the artery feeds, occurs. Without
immediate and appropriate treatment, an embolism
can be fatal.
Femoral artery—An artery located in the groin area
that is the most frequently accessed site for arterial
puncture in angiography.
Fluorescein dye—An orange dye used to illuminate
the blood vessels of the retina in fluorescein angiog-
raphy.
Fluoroscopic screen—A fluorescent screen which
displays “moving x-rays” of the body. Fluoroscopy
allows the radiologist to visualize the guide wire
and catheter he is moving through the patient’s
artery.
Guide wire—A wire that is inserted into an artery to
guides a catheter to a certain location in the body.
Iscehmia—A lack of normal blood supply to a
organ or body part because of blockages or con-
striction of the blood vessels.
Necrosis—Cellular or tissue death; skin necrosis
may be caused by multiple, consecutive doses of
radiation from fluoroscopic or x-ray procedures.
Plaque—Fatty material that is deposited on the
inside of the arterial wall.
Portal hypertension—A condition caused by cirrho-
sis of the liver. It is characterized by impaired or
reversed blood flow from the portal vein to the liver,
an enlarged spleen, and dilated veins in the esopha-
gus and stomach.
Portal vein thrombosis—The development of a

and the possible complications involved, and asked to
sign an informed consent form.
Aftercare
Because life-threatening internal bleeding is a possi-
ble complication of an arterial puncture, an overnight stay
in the hospital is sometimes recommended following an
angiography procedure, particularly with cerebral and
coronary angiograms. If the procedure is performed on an
outpatient basis, the patient is typically kept under close
observation for a period of at six to 12 hours before being
released. If the arterial puncture was performed in the
femoral artery, the patient will be instructed to keep his
leg straight and relatively immobile during the observa-
tion period. The patient’s blood pressure and vital signs
will be monitored and the puncture site observed closely.
Pain medication may be prescribed if the patient is expe-
riencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack is
applied to the site to reduce swelling. It is normal for the
puncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 199  The patient may also develop a hematoma, a hard mass
created by the blood vessels broken during the procedure.
Hematomas should be watched carefully, as they may
indicate continued bleeding of the arterial puncture site.
Angiography patients are also advised to enjoy two
to three days of rest and relaxation after the procedure in
order to avoid placing any undue stresson the arterial
puncture. Patients who experience continued bleeding or
abnormal swelling of the puncture site, sudden dizziness,
or chest pains in the days following an angiography pro-
cedure should seek medical attention immediately.
Patients undergoing a fluorescein angiography
should not drive or expose their eyes to direct sunlight
for 12 hours following the procedure.
Risks
Because angiography involves puncturing an artery,
internal bleeding or hemorrhage are possible complica-
tions of the test. As with any invasive procedure, infec-
tion of the puncture site or bloodstream is also a risk, but
this is rare.
A strokeor heart attackmay be triggered by an
angiogram if blood clots or plaque on the inside of the
arterial wall are dislodged by the catheter and form a
blockage in the blood vessels or artery. The heart may
also become irritated by the movement of the catheter
through its chambers during pulmonary and coronary
angiography procedures, and arrhythmias may develop.
Patients who develop an allergic reaction to the con-
trast medium used in angiography may experience a vari-
ety of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breath-
ing,heart failure, or a sudden drop in blood pressure. If
the patient is aware of the allergy before the test is
administered, certain medications can be administered at
that time to counteract the reaction.
Angiography involves minor exposure to radiation
through the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance used in the
procedure. Unless the patient is pregnant, or multiple
radiological or fluoroscopic studies are required, the
small dose of radiation incurred during a single proce-
dure poses little risk. However, multiple studies requiring
fluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short time
period have been known to cause skin necrosis in some
individuals. This risk can be minimized by careful moni-
toring and documentation of cumulative radiation doses
administered to these patients.
Normal results
The results of an angiogram or arteriogram depend
on the artery or organ system being examined. Generally,
test results should display a normal and unimpeded flow
of blood through the vascular system. Fluorescein
angiography should result in no leakage of fluorescein
dye through the retinal blood vessels.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results of an angiography may display a
restricted blood vessel or arterial blood flow (ischemia)
or an irregular placement or location of blood vessels.
The results of an angiography vary widely by the type of
procedure performed, and should be interpreted and
explained to the patient by a trained radiologist.

Angioplasty
Definition
Angioplasty is a term describing a procedure used to
widen vessels narrowed by stenoses or occlusions. There
are various types of these procedures and their names are
associated with the type of vessel entry and equipment
used. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) and
navigates to the area of the vessel of interest through the
same vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi-
nal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronary
arteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in the
groin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed through
the aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteries
at the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.
Purpose
In individuals with an occulsive vascular disease
such as atherosclerosis, blood flow is impaired to an
organ (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such as
the lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen due
to fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow-
ing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere.
Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flow
is returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at the
same location and the procedure could be repeated.

Angioplasty
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 200  Precautions
Angioplasty procedures are performed on hospital
inpatients in facilities for proper monitoring and recov-
ery. If the procedure is to be performed in a coronary
artery, the patient’s care is likely to be provided by spe-
cially trained physicians, nurses, and vascular specialists.
Typically, patients are given anticoagulants prior to the
procedure to assist in the prevention of thromboses
(blood clots). Administration of anticoagulants, however,
may impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. The
procedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance
and contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio-
plasty may have been made following a diagnostic
angiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrast
media is likely to known. The procedure may then
require the use of non-ionic contrast agents.
Description
Angioplasty was originally performed by dilating the
vessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiff
catheters through the narrowed space. Complications of
this procedure caused researchers to develop means of
widening the vessel using a minimally sized device.
Today, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widen
the vessel and stents to provide structural support for the
vessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of the
fat or calcium plaque. Catheters may also be equipped
with spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque.
Angioplasty may be performed while the patient is
sedated or anesthetized, depending on the vessels
involved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-
plasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will be
kept awake to report on discomfort and coughif
required. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac
catheterizationlabs with sophisticated monitoring
devices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiology
department’s angiographic suite, the patient may be
sedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor the
patient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performed
by a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will be
performed in an operating room or specially designed
vascular procedure suite.
The site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip-
ment is prepared as a sterile surgical site. Although many
procedures are performed by puncturing the vessel
through skin, many procedures are also performed by
surgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of the
vessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to the
vessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel is
punctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopy
is used to monitor small injections of contrast media used
to visualize the path through the vessel. If the fluo-
roscopy system has a feature called ‘roadmap’, the
amount of contrast media injected will be greater in order
to define the full route the guidewire will take. The fluo-
roscopy system will then superimpose subsequent
images over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed,
that is, the physician moves the guidewire along the map
to the destination.
Having reached the area of stenosis, the physician
will inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been

and duration depending on the size and location of the
vessel. In some cases, the use of a stent (a mesh of wire
that resembles a Chinese finger puzzle) may also be
used. The vessel may be widened before, during, or after
the deployment of the stent. Procedures for deploying
stents are dependent on the type of stent used. In cases
where the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of vessels,
the use of a graph may be necessary to provide structural
strength to the vessel. Stents, graphs, and balloon dila-
tion may all be used together or separately.
The procedure is verified using fluoroscopy and
contrast media to produce an angiogram or by using
intravascular ultrasound or both. All equipment is with-
drawn from the vessel and the puncture site repaired.
Risks
During the procedure there is a danger of puncturing
the vessel with the guidewire. This is a very small risk.
Patients must be monitored for hematoma or hemorrhage
at the puncture site. There is also a small risk of heart
attack, emboli, and although unlikely death. Hospital-
ization will vary in length by the patient’s overall condi-
tion, any complications, and availability of home care.

Angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors
Definition
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also
called ACE inhibitors) are medicines that block the con-
version of the chemical angiotensin I to a substance that
increases salt and water retention in the body.
Purpose
ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of high
blood pressure. They may be used alone or in combina-
tion with other medicines for high blood pressure. They
work by preventing a chemical in the blood, angiotensin
I, from being converted into a substance that increases
salt and water retention in the body. Increased salt and
water retention lead to high blood pressure. ACE
inhibitors also make blood vessels relax, which helps
lower blood pressure and allows more oxygen-rich blood
to reach the heart.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2202
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 202  Treating high blood pressure is important because
the condition puts a burden on the heart and the arteries,
which can lead to permanent damage over time. If
untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart
attacks,heart failure,stroke, or kidney failure.
ACE inhibitors may also be prescribed for other
conditions. For example, captopril (Capoten) is used to
treat kidney problems in people who take insulin to con-
trol diabetes. Captopril and lisinopril are also given to
some patients after a heart attack. Heart attacks dam-
age and weaken the heart muscle, and the damage con-
tinues even after a person recovers from the attack. This
medicine helps slow down further damage to the heart.
ACE inhibitors also may be used to treat congestive
heart failure.
Description
ACE inhibitors are available only with a physician’s
prescription and come in tablet, capsule, and injectable
forms. Some commonly used ACE inhibitors are
benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril
(Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil,
Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril (Aceon),
quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and trandolapril
(Mavik).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
ACE inhibitor and the medical condition for which it is
being taken. Check with the physician who prescribed
the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for
the correct dosage.
This medicine may take weeks to noticeably lower
blood pressure. Take it exactly as directed.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it.
Precautions
A person taking an ACE inhibitor should see a
physician regularly. The physician will check the blood
pressure to make sure the medicine is working as it
should and will note any unwanted side effects. People
who have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine.
However, they should continue to see their physicians
even when they feel well so that the physician can keep
a close watch on their condition. It is also important for
patients to keep taking their medicine even when they
feel fine.
ACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure,
but will help control the condition. To avoid the serious
health problems that high blood pressure can cause,
patients may have to take medicine for the rest of their
lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.
Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoid
certain foods, such as salty snacks, and keep their weight
under control. The health care professional who is treat-
ing the condition can offer advice on what measures may
be necessary. Patients being treated for high blood pres-
sure should not change their dietswithout consulting
their physicians.
Anyone taking this medicine for high blood pressure
should not take any other prescription or over-the-
counter (OTC) medicine without first checking with his
or her physician. Some medicines, such as certain cold
remedies, may increase blood pressure.
Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded after taking
the first dose of an ACE inhibitor, especially if they
have been taking a water pill (diuretic). Anyone who
takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do
anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the drugs affect them. Such symptoms
should be reported to the physician or pharmacist if
they do not subside within a day or so. For the first one
or two days of taking an ACE inhibitor, patients may
become lightheaded when arising from bed in the
morning. Patienst should rise slowly to a sitting posi-
tion before standing up.
While a goal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor is to
lower the blood pressure, patients must be careful not to
let their blood pressure get too low. Low blood pressure
can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. To
prevent the blood pressure from getting too low, observe
these precautions:
• Do not drink alcohol without checking with the physi-
cian who prescribed this medicine.
• Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hour
before meals. Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken with
or without meals.
• Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot weather.
The loss of water from the body through heavy sweat-
ing can cause low blood pressure.
• Check with a physician right away if illness occurs
while taking an ACE inhibitor. This is especially true if
the illness involves severe nausea, vomiting, or diar-
rhea. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of too
much water from the body, which can lead to low blood
pressure.
Anyone who is taking ACE inhibitors should be sure
to tell the health care professional in charge before hav-
ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-
gency treatment.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 203  Some ACE inhibitors may change the results of cer-
tain medical tests, such as blood or urine tests. Before
having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should
alert the health care professional in charge.
Do not use a potassium supplement or a salt substi-
tute that contains potassium without first checking with
the physician who prescribed the ACE inhibitor.
Patients who are being treated with bee or wasp
venom to prevent allergic reactions to stings may have a
severe allergic reaction to certain ACE inhibitors.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take ACE inhibitors. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions.
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to an ACE inhibitor in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking this type of medicine
again. The physician should also be told about any aller-
giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.The use of ACE inhibitors in preg-
nancycan cause serious problems and even deathin the
fetus or newborn. Women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with their physicians
before using this medicine. Women who become preg-
nant while taking this medicine should check with their
physicians immediately.
BREASTFEEDING.Some ACE inhibitors pass into
breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should check
with their physicians before using ACE inhibitors.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ACE
inhibitors, people with any of these medical problems
should make sure their physicians are aware of their con-
ditions:
• diabetes
• heart or blood vessel disease
• recent heart attack or stroke
• liver disease
• kidney disease
• kidney transplant
• scleroderma
• systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking ACE inhibitors
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effect is a dry, continuing
cough. This usually does not subside unless the medica-
tion is stopped. Ask the physician if the cough can be
treated. Less common side effects, such as headache,
loss of taste, unusual tiredness, and nausea or diarrhea
also may occur and do not need medical attention unless
they are severe or they interfere with normal activities.
More serious side effects are rare, but may occur. If
any of the following side effects occur, check with a
physician immediately:
• swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs,
hands, or feet
• itchy skin
• sudden breathing or swallowing problems
• chest pain
• hoarseness
• sore throat
• fever and chills
• stomach pain
• yellow eyes or skin
In addition, anyone who has any of the following
symptoms while taking an ACE inhibitor should check
with his or her physician as soon as possible:
• dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting
• confusion
• nervousness
•fever
• joint pain
• numbness or tingling in hands, feet, or lips
• weak or heavy feeling in the legs
• skin rash
• irregular heartbeat
• shortness of breath or other breathing problems
Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking an ACE inhibitor should
get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
ACE inhibitors may interact with certain foods and
other medicines. For example, captopril (Capoten) inter-
acts with food and should be taken one hour before
meals. Anyone who takes ACE inhibitors should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking
and should ask about foods that should be avoided.

KEY TERMS
Arteries—Blood vessels that carry blood away
from the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs of
the body.
Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lasting
condition. Chronic conditions often develop grad-
ually and involve slow changes.
Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,
that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Scleroderma—A disease that first affects the skin
and later affects certain internal organs. The first
symptoms are the hardening, thickening, and

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—A chronic
disease that affects the skin, joints, and certain
internal organs.
Venom—A poisonous substance secreted by an
animal, usually delivered through a bite or a sting.
ACE is to help regulate arterial pressure by converting
angiotensin I to angiotensin II.	Purpose
The ACE test is used primarily to detect and monitor
the clinical course of sarcoidosis(a disease that affects
many organs, especially the lungs), to differentiate
between sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to delin-
eate between active and inactive sarcoid disease. Elevat-
ed ACE levels are also found in a number of other condi-
tions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare familial disor-
der of fat metabolism) and leprosy.
Precautions
It should be noted that people under 20 years of age
normally have very high ACE levels. Decreased levels may
be seen in the condition of excess fat in the blood (hyper-
lipidemia). Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levels
include ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.
Description
ACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone
mechanism which controls blood pressure by converting
angiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved in
regulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac-
tive, but when converted by ACE to the active form,
angiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small blood
vessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres-
sure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos-
terone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer-
tain kidney disorders increase the production of
angiotensin II, another cause of hypertension. Despite
the action of ACE on blood pressure regulation, determi-
nation of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluation
of hypertension (high blood pressure).
Preparation
Determination of ACE levels requires a blood sam-
ple. The patient need not be fasting.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the puncture site,faintingor feeling
lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (blood
accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for this test are laboratory-specific
but can range from 8-57 U/ml for patients over 20 years
of age.

Serum ACE levels are elevated in approximately 80-
90% of patients with active sarcoidosis. Thyroid hor-
mone may have an effect on ACE activity, as hypothyroid
(low thyroid) patients, as well as patients with anorexia
nervosawith associated findings of hypothyroidism,
may have low serum ACE activity. ACE can also be
decreased in lung cancer(bronchogenic carcinoma).

Animal bite infections
Definition
The most common problem following an animal bite
is simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is known
to contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to one
recent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up in
about 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it can
then transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor-
ganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec-
tion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis-
comfort to life-threatening complications.
Description
Two to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in
the United States and about 1% of bites require hospital-
ization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency room
visits per year, which represents approximately 1% of all
emergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil-
lion dollars in health care expenses and lost income.
KEY TERMS
Sarcoidosis—Sarcoidosis is a rare disease of
unknown cause in which inflammation occurs in
lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the
body, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.
Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with
5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men are
more often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereas
women are more often bitten by cats (3:1).
Dog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents.
Cats account for about 10% of reported bites, and other
animals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons,
bats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5-
10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently than
dog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15-
20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi-
mately 30-50% of cat bites become infected.
Many factors contribute to the infection rates, such
as, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the location
of the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bitten
person, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com-
pliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound.
Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because they have
rounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adult
dog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres-
sure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury,
causing damage to deep structures such as bones, blood
vessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teeth
are also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations.
Cats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc-
ture wounds. Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the
surface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teeth
essentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar-
row wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impaired
immunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIV
infection—are especially vulnerable to infection.
The bacterial species most commonly found in bite
wounds include Pasteurella multocida,Staphylococcus
aureus,Pseudomonas sp, and Streptococcus sp. P. multoci-
da, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent
in cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animal
bites include cat-scratch disease,tetanusand rabies.
Causes and symptoms
The most common sign of infection from an animal
bite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is red
and feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearby
lymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise if
the infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc-
tures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurs
on the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely.
Live, disease-causing bacteria within the blood-
stream and tissues cause complications far from the
wound site. Such complications include meningitis,
brain abscesses,pneumoniaand lung abscesses, and
heart infections, among others. These complications can
be fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints

marrow or septic arthritis.
Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella hense-
lae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva; infection
may be transmitted by a bite or scratch. Approximately
22,000 cases are reported each year in the United States;
worldwide, nine out of every 100,000 individuals
become infected. More than 80% of reported cases occur
in persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor-
mally severe in individuals with healthy immune sys-
tems. Symptoms may become serious, however, in
immunocompromised individuals, such as those with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those
undergoing chemotherapy. Common symptoms include
an inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch,
swollen lymph nodes,fever,fatigue, and rash.
Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted through
the bite of an animal that is already infected. More than
90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such as
skunks, bats, and raccoons, with domestic animals such as
dogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between
35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year as
a result of rabies. The highest incidence of rabies occurs in
Asia where, in 1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, most
occurring in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the U.S. due
to good animal control practice. The delay of onset is usu-
ally weeks to months after being bitten. Early symptoms
of rabies include fever,headache, and flu-like symptoms.
These progress to anxiety,hallucinations, muscle
spasms, partial paralysis, fear of water (hydrophobia), and
other neurological symptoms as the virus spreads to the
central nervous system. Medical treatment must be sought
soon after exposure because deathinvariably follows once
the infection becomes established.
Diagnosis
A medical examination involves taking the history of
the injury and assessing the wound type and damage.
Tetanus immunization and general health status are
checked. An x ray may be ordered to assess bone damage
and to check for foreign objectsin the wound. Wound
cultures are done for infected bites if the victim is at high
risk for complications or if the infection does not respond
to treatment. Evaluation of possible exposure to rabies is
also important. A biting animal suspected of having rabies
is usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a period
of time for evidence of pre-existing infection.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the wound type, its site, and
risk factors for infection. All wounds are cleaned and dis-
infected as thoroughly as possible. Bites to the head and
face usually receive sutures, as do severe lacerations
elsewhere. Puncture wounds are left open. If abscessfor-
mation occurs, the physician may perform an incision so
as to drain the abscess.
If infection occurs,antibioticsare prescribed.
Antibiotics may also be used for infection prevention.
Since a single bite wound may contain many different
types of bacteria, no single antibiotic is always effective.
Commonly prescribed antibiotics are penicillin or a com-
bination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.
Because rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics are
not effective. In addition, as of 2001, there is no known
cure for the disease once symptoms become apparent. It
is therefore recommended that individuals with a high
risk of contracting the disease (veterinarians, animal han-
dlers, some laboratory workers) receive preexposure vac-

rapid animal should receive postexposure vaccination,
also called postexposure prophylaxis(PEP). The PEP
regimen consists of one vaccine given at the initial visit
as well as one dose of human immune globulin. Addi-
tional vaccines given on days 3, 7, 14, and 28.
Prognosis
Once a bacterial infection is halted, the bite victim usu-
ally recovers fully. There is no known cure for rabies once
symptoms become evident and death is almost certain.
WHO reports that 114 rabies deaths occurred in the Americ-
as in 1997, with only four deaths occurring that year in the
United States, thus emphasizing the importance of good
animal control practice and postexposure prophylaxis.

Preventing bites obviously prevents subsequent

dogs very cautiously, especially on their territory. Final-
ly, animals should not be trained to fight.

Ankylosing spondylitis
Definition
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) refers to inflammation
of the joints in the spine. AS is also known as rheumatoid
spondylitis or Marie-Strümpell disease (among other
names).
Description
A form of arthritis, AS is characterized by chronic
inflammation, causing painand stiffness of the back,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2208
Ankylosing spondylitis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 208  progressing to the chest and neck. Eventually, the whole
back may become curved and inflexible if the bones fuse
(this is known as “bamboo spine”). AS is a systemic dis-
order that may involve multiple organs, such as the:
• eye (causing an inflammation of the iris, or iritis)
• heart (causing aortic valve disease)
• lungs
• skin (causing a scaly skin condition, or psoriasis)
• gastrointestinal tract (causing inflammation within the
small intestine, called ileitis, or inflammation of the
large intestine, called colitis)
Less than 1% of the population has AS; however,
20% of AS sufferers have a relative with the disorder.
Causes and symptoms
Genetics play an important role in the disease, but
the cause of AS is still unknown. More than 90% of
patients have a gene called HLA-B27, but only 10-15%
of those who inherit the gene develop the disease. Symp-
toms of AS include:
• low back and hip pain and stiffness
• difficulty expanding the chest
• pain in the neck, shoulders, knees, and ankles
• low-grade fever
• fatigue
• weight loss
AS is seen most commonly in males 30 years old
and older. Initial symptoms are uncommon after the age
of 30, although the diagnosis may not be established
until after that age. The incidence of AS in Afro-Ameri-
cans is about 25% of the incidence in Caucasians.
Diagnosis
Doctors usually diagnose the disease simply by the
patient’s report of pain and stiffness. Doctors also review
spinal and pelvic x rays since involvement of the hip and
pelvic joints is common and may be the first abnormality
seen on the x ray. The doctor may also order a blood test
to determine the presence of HLA-B27 antigen. When a
diagnosis is made, patients may be referred to a rheuma-
tologist, a doctor who specializes in treating arthritis.
Patients may also be referred to an orthopedic surgeon, a
doctor who can surgically correct joint or bone disorders.
Treatment
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs),
like naproxen (Naprosyn) or indomethacin (Indocin) are
used to relieve pain and stiffness. In severe cases, sul-
fasalazine (Azulfidine), another drug to reduce inflam-
mation, or methotrexate (Rheumatrex), an immune-sup-
pressing drug, is recommended. In cases where chronic
therapy is needed, potential drug side effects must be
taken into consideration. Corticosteroid drugs are effec-
tive in relieving symptoms, but are usually reserved for
severe cases that do not improve when NSAIDs are used.
To avoid potential side effects, treatment with corticos-
teroidsis usually limited to a short amount of time with
a gradual weaning from the drug.
Physical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent a
stooped posture and breathing problems when the spine
starts to fuse and ribs are affected. Back braces may be
used to prevent continued deformity of the spine and
ribs. Only in severe cases of deformity is surgery per-
formed to straighten and realign the spine, or to replace
knee, shoulder, or hip joints.
Alternative treatment
To reduce inflammation various herbal remedies,
including white willow (Salix alba), yarrow (Achillea
millefolium), and lobelia (Lobelia inflata), may be help-
ful. Acupuncture, performed by a trained professional,
has helped some patients manage their pain. Homeopath-
ic practitioners may prescribe such remedies as Bryonia
and Rhus toxicodendronfor pain relief.
Prognosis
There is no cure for AS, and the course of the disease
is unpredictable. Generally, AS progresses for about 10
years and then its progression levels off. Most patients
can lead normal lives with treatment to control symptoms.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent AS.

Anorectal disorders
Definition
Anorectal disorders are a group of medical disorders
that occur at the junction of the anal canal and the rec-
tum.
Description
The anal canal, also called the anus, is the opening at
the bottom end of the digestive tract and is a combination
of external skin and tissue from the digestive tract. It has
many sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain. The rectum
is the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucus
layer as its inside surface. It has very few sensory nerves
and is, therefore, relatively insensitive to pain. The anal
canal has a ring of muscle, called the anal sphincter,
which keeps the anus closed. There are a number of dif-
ferent anorectal disorders.
KEY TERMS
Ankylosing—When bones of a joint are fused,
stiff, or rigid.
HLA-B27—An antigen or protein marker on cells
that may indicate ankylosing spondylitis.
Immune suppressing—Anything that reduces the
activity of the immune system.
Inflammation—A reaction of tissues to disease or
injury, often associated with pain and swelling.
Spondylitis—An inflammation of the spine.
Causes and symptoms
Hemorrhoidsare swollen or varicose veinsin the
anal canal and rectum. They may become inflamed,
enlarged, or protrude from the anorectal area. Hemor-
rhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement. The
amount of bleeding is typically small. Frequently, hem-
orrhoids develop because of straining during bowel
movements, especially if the person has constipation.
An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus that
is usually caused by a hard bowel movement. Fissures
are painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed during
bowel movements.
Anorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-form-
ing infections in the anorectal region. Painful abscesses
form under the skin.
An anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan-
nel from the anorectal area to another part of the body.
Typically, the channel leads to pockets of skin near the
anus. When seen in infants, anorectal fistulas are consid-
ered birth defects. These are seen more frequently in
boys than in girls. Fistulas are also seen more frequently
in people who have other diseases, including Crohn’s
disease,tuberculosis,cancer, and diverticulitis. Anorec-
tal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses or
other injury to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painful
and discharge pus.
Proctitisis an inflammation of the internal mucosal
lining of the rectum. Ulcers of the lining may form and
develop into ulcerative colitis. There are many causes of
proctitis, including the sexually transmitted diseases
chlamydia and herpes simplex infections. Proctitis is fre-
quently seen in homosexual males as a consequence of
anorectal infection. Proctitis itself is not painful, but pain
may be caused by the infectious agent.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin
around the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the rectum
with a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short instrument
that allows the physician to view the inside of the anus. A
proctoscope is a longer, rigid viewing tube of approxi-
mately six to ten inches in length, which may be used to
look for anorectal disorders. A sigmoidoscope is a
longer, flexible tube, that allows the physician to view up
to about two feet of the inside of the large intestine. Tis-
sue samples and material for microbial culture may be
obtained during the examination.
Treatment
Treatment usually isn’t required for hemorrhoids.
Most hemorrhoids will heal if the patient takes stool soft-

Anorectal disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 210  eners to relieve the constipation. Enlarged blood vessels
can be eliminated by surgery if they are considered a
severe problem. In the case of fissures, treatment
involves stool softeners that eliminate stresson the fis-
sure during bowel movements, which allows the fissure
to heal. If the fissure doesn’t heal, surgery is required.
Treatment for anorectal abscesses consists of cutting the
abscessand draining the pus. Fistulas are treated by
surgery.The usual treatment for proctitis is antibiotics.

Anorexia nervosa
Definition
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized
by unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation, and
conspicuous distortion of body image. The name comes
from two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat.
In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia ner-
vosa is usually marked by amenorrhea, or skipping at
least three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, or DSM-IV(1994), defines two subtypes of
anorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized by
strict dieting and exercisewithout binge eating; and a
binge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com-
pulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting and
the use of laxativesor enemas. DSM-IVdefines a binge
as a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode of
compulsive eating in which the individual consumes a
significantly larger amount of food than most people
would eat in similar circumstances.
Description
Anorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a
psychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSMin
1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles-
cent females. Its incidence in the United States has dou-
bled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported cases
reflects a genuine increase in the number of persons
affected by the disorder, and not simply earlier or more
accurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex-
ia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female adoles-
cents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorder
as of 1998 are female. It was originally thought that only
5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is being
revised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis-
order is 14-18 years, although there are patients who
develop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s and
1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- and
middle-class women, but that generalization is also
changing. More recent studies indicate that anorexia is
increasingly common among women of all races and
social classes in the United States.
Anorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem
not only because of its rising incidence, but also because
it has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric
disorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious long-
term health complications, including congestive heart
failure, sudden death, growth retardation, dental prob-
lems,constipation, stomach rupture, swelling of the
salivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of the
blood, loss of kidney function, and osteoporosis.
Causes and symptoms
Anorexia is a disorder that results from the interac-
tion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biological
factors. While the precise cause of the disease is not
known, it has been linked to the following:
Social influences
The rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect
the present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper-
class status as well as of female beauty. In addition, the
increase in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav-
ior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi-
tating other girls.
The onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to
a developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodies
coupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks.
The increasing influence of the mass media in spreading
and reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted.
Occupational goals
The risk of developing anorexia is higher among
adolescents preparing for careers that require attention to
weight and/or appearance. These high-risk groups
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	211
Anorectal disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 211  include dancers, fashion models, professional athletes
(including gymnasts, skaters, long-distance runners, and
jockeys), and actresses.
Genetic and biological influences
Women whose biological mothers or sisters have the
disorder appear to be at increased risk.
Psychological factors
A number of theories have been advanced to explain
the psychological aspects of the disorder. No single
explanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has been
interpreted as:
• A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection is
variously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or as
a desire to resemble men as closely as possible.
• A reaction to sexual abuseor assault.
• A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos-
sible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female pas-
sivity and weakness are attractive to men.
• Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen-
dence. Some anorexics come from achievement-orient-
ed families that stressphysical fitness and dieting.
Many anorexics are perfectionistic and “driven” about
schoolwork and other matters in addition to weight
control.
• Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a
daughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction from
marital discord or other family tensions.
• Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu-
rately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding.
Male anorexics
Although anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis-
order that largely affects women, its incidence in the
male population is rising. Less is known about the causes
of anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the same
as for females. These include certain occupational goals
and increasing media emphasis on external appearance in
men. Moreover, homosexual males are under pressure to
conform to an ideal body weight that is about 20 pounds
lighter than the standard “attractive” weight for hetero-
sexual males.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a
number of factors. One is that the disorder varies some-
what in severity from patient to patient. A second factor
is denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor-
der. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually
brought to treatment by a family member.
Most anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or
family practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod-
ies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low blood
pressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (fail-
ure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdomi-
nal pain, constipation, or lack of energy. The patient may
feel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downy
body hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may have
eroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the back
of the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure-
ment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IVspecifies a
weight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal,
with some allowance for body build and weight history.
The doctor will need to rule out other physical condi-
tions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating,
including metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especially
hypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of the
digestive tract, and a condition called superior mesenteric
artery syndrome. Persons with this condition sometimes
vomit after meals because the blood supply to the intes-
tine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood tests,
an electrocardiogram,urinalysis, and bone densitometry
(bone density test) in order to exclude other diseases and
to assess the patient’s nutritional status.
The doctor will also need to distinguish between
anorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including depres-
sion,schizophrenia, social phobia,obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Two diagnostic
tests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes Test
(EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).
Treatment
Treatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short-
and long-term measures, and requires assessment by
dietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists.
Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s resistance
or failure to carry out treatment plan.
Hospital treatment
Hospitalization is recommended for anorexics with
any of the following characteristics:
• weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss
over a three-month period of more than 30 pounds
• severely disturbed metabolism
• severe binging and purging
• signs of psychosis
• severe depression or risk of suicide
• family in crisis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2212
Anorectal disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 212  Hospital treatment includes individual and group
therapyas well as refeeding and monitoring of the
patient’s physical condition. Treatment usually requires
two to four months in the hospital. In extreme cases, hos-
pitalized patients may be force-fed through a tube insert-
ed in the nose (nasogastric tube) or by over-feeding
(hyperalimentation techniques).
Outpatient treatment
Anorexics who are not severely malnourished can be
treated by outpatient psychotherapy. The types of treat-
ment recommended are supportive rather than insight-ori-
ented, and include behavioral approaches as well as indi-
vidual or group therapy. Family therapyis often recom-
mended when the patient’s eating disorder is closely tied
to family dysfunction. Self-help groups are often useful in
helping anorexics find social support and encouragement.
Psychotherapy with anorexics is a slow and difficult
process; about 50% of patients continue to have serious
psychiatric problems after their weight has stabilized.
Medications
Anorexics have been treated with a variety of med-
ications, including antidepressants,antianxiety drugs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and lithium
carbonate. The effectiveness of medications in treatment
regimens is still debated. However, at least one study of
Prozac showed it helped the patient maintain weight
gained while in the hospital.
Prognosis
Figures for long-term recovery vary from study to
study, but the most reliable estimates are that 40-60% of
anorexics will make a good physical and social recovery,
and 75% will gain weight. The long-term mortality rate
for anorexia is estimated at around 10%, although some
studies give a lower figure of 3-4%. The most frequent
causes of death associated with anorexia are starvation,
electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, and suicide.
Prevention
Short of major long-term changes in the larger soci-
ety, the best strategy for prevention of anorexia is the cul-
tivation of healthy attitudes toward food, weight control,
and beauty (or body image) within families.

Anoscopy
Definition
An anoscopy is an examination of the rectum in
which a small tube is inserted into the anus to screen, diag-
nose, and evaluate problems of the anus and anal canal.
Purpose
This test may be ordered for the evaluation of peri-
anal or anal pain,hemorrhoids,rectal prolapse, digital
rectal examinationthat shows a mass, perianal abscess
and condyloma (a wart-like growth). An anascopy may
be performed to check for abnormal openings between
the anus and the skin, or anal fissures. The test is also
used to diagnose rectal cancer.
Precautions
Anoscopy should not be performed on patients with
acute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reac-
tion it may cause. This test is also not recommended for
patients with acute abdominal problems and those with a
constricted or narrowed anal canal.
Description
Anoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using an
anoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped specu-
lum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope. Before
the anoscope is used, the doctor completes a digital rectal
examination with a lubricated, gloved index finger. The
anoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a few
inches into the rectum. This procedure enlarges the rec-
tum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal with
a light. If any suspicious areas are noticed, a piece of tis-
sue can be biopsied.
During the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel-
ing of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom. If a
biopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch. The
procedure is performed on an out-patient basis, and takes
approximately an hour to complete.
Preparation
The patient will be instructed to clear their rectum of
stool before the procedure. This may be done by taking a
KEY TERMS
Anal fissure—An ulcer on the margin of the anus.
Digital rectal examination—An examination
where a gloved, lubricated index finger is inserted
into the rectum to check for any abnormalities.
Polyps—A tumor with a small flap that attaches
itself to the wall of various vascular organs such as
the nose, uterus and rectum. Polyps bleed easily,
and if they are suspected to be cancerous they
should be surgically removed.
Vasovagal reaction—Regarding the action of stim-
uli from the vagus nerve on blood vessels.
laxative, enema, or other preparation that may help with
the evacuation.
Aftercare
If a biopsy is needed during an anoscopy, there may
be slight anal bleeding for less than two days following
the procedure. The patient may be instructed to sit in a
bathtub of warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, three times a
day, to help decrease the pain and swelling.
Risks
A simple anoscopy procedure offers minimal risks.
There is a limited risk of bleeding and mild pain is a
biopsy is performed.
Normal results
Normal values to look for during an anoscopy
include an anal canal that appears healthy in size, color,
and shape. The test also looks for no evidence of bleed-
ing, polyps, hemorrhoids or other abnormalities.
Abnormal results
While an anoscopy is typically performed to deter-
mine is hemorrhoids are present, other abnormal finding
could include polyps, abscesses, inflammation, fissures,
colorectal polyps, or cancer.

Anosmia
Definition
The term anosmia means lack of the sense of smell.
It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. Ageusia, a
companion word, refers to a lack of taste sensation.
Patients who actually have anosmia may complain
wrongly of ageusia, although they retain the ability to
distinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter—humans’ only
taste sensations.
Description
Of the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance
for humans, although it is much more pronounced in
other animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell an
odor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste, consid-
ered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food in the
mouth. The sense of smell originates from the first cranial
nerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at the base of the
brain’s frontal lobes, right behind the eyes and above the
nose. Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves.
There are other aberrations of smell beside a
decrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or halluci-
nated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction of
the brain.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu-
sion caused by rhinitis(inflammation of the nasal mem-
branes). If no air gets to the olfactory nerves, smell will
not happen. In turn, rhinitis and nasal polyps(growths
on nasal membranes) are caused by irritants such as
allergens, infections, cigarette smoke, and other air pol-
lutants. Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block the
nasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anos-
mia. Head injuryor, rarely, certain viral infections can
damage or destroy the olfactory nerves.
Diagnosis
It is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one
complains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a physi-
cian usually begins by testing each nostril separately
with a common, non-irritating odor such as perfume,
lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis are obvious
causal agents a physician looks for. Imaging studies of
the head may be necessary in order to detect brain injury,
sinus infection, or tumor.
Treatment
Cessation of smokingis the first step. Many smok-
ers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically that
they immediately gain weight. Attention to reducing
exposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respira-
tory allergiesor chronic upper respiratory infections will
be beneficial. Corticosteroidsare particularly helpful.
Alternative treatment
Finding and treating the cause of the loss of smell is
the first approach in naturopathic medicine. If rhinitis
is the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cell
stabilizers and herbal decongestantscan offer some
relief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present, this
is often related to an environmental irritant or to food
allergies. Removal of the causative factors is the first step
to healing. Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief of
the blockage and tonification of the membranes. Block-
ages can sometimes be resolved through naso-specific
therapy—a way of realigning the nasal cavities. Polyp
blockage can be addressed through botanical medicine
treatment as well as hydrotherapy. Olfactory nerve
damage may not be regenerable. Some olfactory aberra-
tions, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolved
using homeopathic medicine.
Prognosis
If nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the
chances of recovery are excellent. However, if nerve
damage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of smell
is much more difficult.

Anoxia
Definition
Anoxia is a condition characterized by an absence of
oxygen supply to an organ or a tissue.
Description
Anoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered to
a part of the body. If the condition does not involve total
oxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia, although
the two terms have been used interchangeably. A related
condition, anoxemia, occurs when the blood circulates
but contains a below normal amount of oxygen.
The five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox-
emic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic. Hypox-
emic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outside
the body is so low that the hemoglobin, the chemical
which carries oxygen in the red blood cells (RBCs), is
unable to become fully loaded with the gas. This results in
too little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suf-
focation when a person is at high altitude, where the pres-
sure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level.
Anemic anoxia results from a decrease in the
amount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, which
reduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemia
may result from lack of production of red blood cells
KEY TERMS
Allergen—Any substance that irritates only those
who are sensitive (allergic) to it.
Corticosteroids—Cortisone, prednisone, and
related drugs that reduce inflammation.
Rhinitis—Inflammation and swelling of the nasal
membranes.
Nasal polyps—Drop-shaped overgrowths of the
nasal membranes.
(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortened
lifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).
Affinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry of
the blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick up
as much oxygen from the air, even though the quantities
are normal, reducing how much is delivered to the tissues.
Stagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference
with the blood flow, although the blood and its oxygen-
carrying abilities are normal. A common cause of general
stagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with the
return of blood flow through the veins. Examples of local
stagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases that
restrict circulation to the extremities, and ergot poison-
ing. When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced ability
to accept and use the oxygen, it is called histotoxic anox-
ia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where the
chemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for the
cell to use oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide can-
not use the oxygen even though it is in normal amounts
in the bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be caused
by exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, ace-
tone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.
Causes and symptoms
Anoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number of
disease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulation
including heart attack, severe asthma, or emphysema.
It can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhala-
tion, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning, strangu-
lation,near-drowning, or high altitude exposure through
mountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressur-
ized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain damage, is a
particular problem with newborns during difficult births.
No matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptoms
are similar. In severe cases, the patient is often confused
and commonly stuperous or comatose (in a state of
unconsciousness). Depending on the severity of the injury
to the brain, the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygen
intake, this condition can persist for hours, days, weeks,
or even months or years. Seizures, myoclonic jerks (invol-
untary muscle spasms or twitches), and neck stiffness are
some other symptoms of the anoxic condition.
Symptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen
deprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing rate,
lightheadedness,dizziness, tingling or warm sensation,
sweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a bluish tint
to skin, particularly the fingertips and lips, and behavior
changes, often an inappropriate sense of euphoria.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly made
through the appearance of clinical symptoms. However,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2216
Anoxia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 216  suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the tissues can be
confirmed using laboratory tests. The exact test that is
performed is dependent on the suspected cause of the
anoxia. One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is the
serum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced to
produce energy without oxygen, as would happen during
anoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, an
increase in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis-
sues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygen
pathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con-
tains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, some
forms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrations
in the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels are
not associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for this
test is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition.
Treatment
The exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on the
cause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues. How-
ever, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levels
through supplementing the patient’s air supply with
100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary steps
often include support of the cardiovascular system
through drugs or other treatment, treatment of lung dis-
ease, transfusions, or administration of anecdotes for poi-
soning, as appropriate.
Prognosis
A good prognosis is dependent on the ability to treat
the underlying cause of the low oxygen levels. If cardio-
vascular and respiratory systems can be supported ade-
quately, recovery from the injury to the tissue is possible,
although extent of injury to the brain can be difficult to
assess. The exact amount of recovery varies with the
amount of injury sustained, where significant injury brings
a poorer prognosis. As recovery occurs, both psychologi-
cal and neurological abnormalities may appear, persist,
and can improve. Some problems seen after anoxia
include mental confusion, personality changes,amnesia
or other types of memory loss,hallucinations, and persis-
tent myoclonus (involuntary contractions of the muscles).
Prevention
Hypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing sup-
plemental oxygen when in high altitudes and being
aware of the early symptoms of altitude sicknessand
reducing altitude once recognized. Iron supplements can
avoid anemic hypoxia, although more severe anemic
states are usually caused by disease or bleeding. Main-
taining good cardiovascular health through proper diet
and exerciseis a good first step to avoiding the most

Antacids
Definition
Antacids are medicines that neutralize stomach acid.
Purpose
Antacids are used to relieve acid indigestion, upset
stomach, sour stomach, and heartburn. Additional com-
ponents of some formulations include dimethicone, to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	217
Antacids
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 217  reduce gas pains (flatulence) and alginic acid, which, in
combination with antacids, may help manage GERD
(gastro-esophageal reflux disease). Antacids should not
be confused with gastric acid inhibitors, such as the H-2
receptor blockers (cimetidine, ranitide and others) or the
proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, omeprazole and
others). Although all three classes of drugs act to reduce
the levels of gastric acid, their mechanisms are different,
and this affects the appropriate use of the drug. Antacids
have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and are
most appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort for
a short period of time.
Antacids may be divided into two classes, those that
work by chemical neutralization of gastric acid, most
notably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act by
adsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids), such as
calcium and magnesium salts.
The chemical antacids show the most rapid onset of
action, but may cause “acid rebound,” a condition in
which the gastric acid returns in greater concentration
after the drug effect has stopped. Also, since these
antacids may contain high concentrations of sodium,
they may be inappropriate in patients with hypertension.
Calcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption of
the acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect, but
may have other significant disadvantages. These
antacids are particularly prone to drug interactions, and
patients taking other medications must often avoid
simultaneous administration of the medications. These
antacids are more effective in liquid formulations than
in tablet or capsule form, and so may be inconvenient
for routine dosing.
The non-absorbable antacids may have additional
uses beyond control of hyperacidity. Calcium salts may
be used as diet supplements in prevention of osteoporo-
sis. Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate,
and has been effective in treatment and control of hyper-
phosphatemia or for use with a low phosphate diet to pre-
vent formation of phosphate urinary stones. This applica-
tion is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renal
failure. Antacids with aluminum and magnesium hydrox-
ides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively prevent
significant stressulcer bleeding in post-operative
patients or those with severe burns.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the type of antacid. Consult
specific references.
When using antacids in chewable tablet form, chew
the tablet well before swallowing. Drink a glass of water
after taking chewable aluminum hydroxide. Lozenges
should be allowed to dissolve completely in the mouth.
Liquid antacids should be shaken well before using.
Precautions
Antacids should be avoided if any signs of appen-
dicitisor inflamed bowel are present. These include
cramping,pain, and soreness in the lower abdomen,
bloating, and nausea and vomiting.
Antacids may affect the results of some medical
tests, such as those that measure how much acid the
stomach produces. Health care providers and patients
should keep this in mind when scheduling a medical test.
Antacids that contain magnesium may cause diar-
rhea. Other types of antacids may cause constipation.
Avoid taking antacids containing sodium bicarbon-
ate when the stomach is uncomfortably full from eating
or drinking.
Antacids should not be given to children under six
years of age.
Antacids that contain calcium or sodium bicarbonate
may cause side effects, such as dizziness, nausea, and
vomiting, in people who consume large amounts of calci-
um (from dairy products or calcium supplements). In
some cases, this can lead to permanent kidney damage.
Before combining antacids with extra calcium, check
with a physician.
Some antacids contain large amounts of sodium,
particularly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Anyone
who is on a low-sodium diet should check the list of
ingredients or check with a physician or pharmacist
before taking an antacid product.
Excessive use of antacids may cause or increase the
severity or kidney problems. Calcium based antacids
may lead to renal stone formation.
ALLERGIES.Allergiesto antacids are extremely rare,
however the inactive ingredients in some formulations
may include dyes or other products with allergic poten-
tial.
PREGNANCY.Antacids are not classified under the
pregnancysafety categories A, B, C, D and X. Occa-
sional use of antacids in small amounts during pregnancy
is considered safe. However, pregnant women should
check with their physicians before using antacids or any
other medicines. Pregnant women who are consuming
extra calcium should be aware that using antacids that
contain sodium bicarbonate or calcium can lead to seri-
ous side effects.
BREASTFEEDING.Some antacids may pass into
breast milk. However, no evidence exists that the inges-

Antacids
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 218  tion of antacids through breast milk causes problems for
nursing babies whose mothers use antacids occasionally.
Side effects
Side effects are very rare when antacids are taken as
directed. They are more likely when the medicine is
taken in large doses or over a long time. Minor side
effects include a chalky taste, mild constipation or diar-
rhea, thirst, stomach cramps, and whitish or speckled
stools. These symptoms do not need medical attention
unless they do not go away or they interfere with normal
activities.
Other uncommon side effects may occur. Anyone
who has unusual symptoms after taking antacids should
get in touch with his or her health care provider.
Interactions
Antacids have multiple drug interactions, usually
due to inhibition of absorption of other medications. In
rare cases, the absorbable antacids may alter the pH of
the stomach contents or urine sufficiently to alter drug
absoprtion or excretion. Consult specific references.

Antenatal testing
Definition
Antenatal testing includes any diagnostic procedures
performed before the birth of a baby.
Purpose
These tests and exams are essential for protecting
the health of a pregnant woman and her developing child.
Precautions
Some tests, such as amniocentisis, carry a small risk
of a miscarriageor other complications that could harm
the mother or baby.
Description
Women who become pregnant undergo a wide vari-
ety of tests throughout the nine months before delivery.
In the early stages, physicians order blood tests to screen
for possible disorders or infections, such as human
immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), which can pass from the
mother to the fetus. Later, the focus shifts to checking on
fetal well-being with a variety of technological tools
such as ultrasound scans. Descriptions of the most com-
mon tests and procedures used during pregnancyare
listed below.
When a woman first learns she is pregnant, her
physician will run a series of routine urine and blood
tests to determine her blood type, check for anemia and
gestational diabetes, make sure she is immune to rubel-
la(German measles) and check for infectious diseases
like HIV, hepatitis, chlamydia or syphilis. Physicians
also usually do pelvic examto screen for cervical can-
cerand check the patient’s blood pressure. As the preg-
nancy progresses, more tests will follow.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound is a device that records sound waves as
they bounce off the developing fetus to create an image,
which is projected onto a large computer screen. Physi-
cians order an ultrasound scan to listen for a fetal heart-
beat, determine a woman’s precise due date and check for
twins, among other uses. An ultrasound scan also is known
as a sonogram. The procedure takes a few minutes, is pain-
less and usually is covered by health insurance.
The ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant
woman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.
The technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stom-
ach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound

Antenatal testing
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 219  waves better. In certain cases, the technician may insert a
plastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get a
clearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the test
may need to be done with a full bladder.
Unlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during preg-
nancy. It does not cause any known side-effects that
would harm the mother or baby.
Pregnant women usually will have their first ultra-
sound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In
normal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal
heartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the screen.
Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to make
sure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birth
canal head first.
Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus has
stopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed without
a fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later in pregnan-
cy, it also may show that the child is in a breech position,
oriented feet first, which can cause a difficult labor.
Tests for birth defects
Most obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways to
find out if their developing child might have birth
defectssuch as spina bifidaand Down Syndrome. An
alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple
blood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and
18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child
will have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works by
measuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance pro-
duced by a fetus with birth defects. Low levels of alpha
fetoprotein in the mother’s blood may indicate Down’s
Syndrome. In that case, the next step for most couples is
amniocentesisbecause the alpha fetoprotein test can
give false-positive results. Amniocentesis is a more accu-
rate test, but it also has higher risks of complications.
This procedure typically is used to diagnose Down
syndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,
at 15-28 weeks.
During amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle
through a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix.
Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the uterus
to withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac.
Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied in
the laboratory. Scientists can analyze DNA samples to
determine if the fetus has Down syndrome or other
genetic conditions. Amniocentesis also can determine the
sex of the fetus.
Women who have a history of recurring miscar-
riages may not want to have this procedure.
Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s
office on an outpatient basis.
Common side effects include cramping and bleeding.
In about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis
causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall, which could
result in miscarriage.
In most cases, couples find out their baby does not
have a birth defect.
If the results come back positive for Down’s Syn-
drome or other serious conditions, the couple must
decide if they want to end the pregnancy. Others use the
knowledge to plan and prepare any special care needed
for their future child.
Group B Strep
This test is for Group B streptococci (GBS) infection.
By testing for GBS, physicians can determine if a
woman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child.
Women who have had a prior child with GBS, or
who have a feveror prolonged or premature rupture of
the amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of
infection.
GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the
vagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat, GBS
can be present in a person’s body without causing any
symptoms, so many women do not realize they are
infected with it.
To test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take a
urine sample. They also may collect samples from the
vagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab. This
test is usually performed late in pregnancy, at 35-37
weeks of gestation.
This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no
side effects.
In many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of
this type of infection.
If a woman is found to be infected with Group B
strep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just before
labor begins. At that time, they may give the mother
antibioticsso the baby is not born with the infection.
Newborns who are exposed to Group B strep can have
inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs.
In some cases, this serious complication can result in
infant death.

Antepartum testing
Definition
Antepartum testing consists of a variety of tests per-
formed late in pregnancyto verify fetal well-being, as
judged by the baby’s heart rate and other characteristics.
Antepartum tests include the nonstress test (NST), bio-
physical profile, and contraction stress test(CST).
Purpose
Antepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks of
pregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can be

warned of any problems that may necessitate further test-
ing or immediate delivery. The results reflect the adequa-
cy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the fetus from
the placenta.
Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies at
high risk for fetal complications. Various reasons
include:
• any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood
pressure or diabetes
• problems with previous pregnancies, such as stillbirth
• fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retar-
dation(a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth defects
• problems in the current pregnancy, including pre-
eclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood pres-
sure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, prema-
ture rupture of the membranes, excessive amniotic fluid
(the liquid that surrounds the fetus), vaginal bleeding,
or placenta previa(a condition in which the placenta is
positioned over the cervix instead of near the top of the
uterus)
• twins or other multiple fetuses
One of the most common indications for antepartum
testing is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy should not
be allowed to continue past 42 weeks. (The usual preg-
nancy is 40 weeks in duration). Babies should be moni-
tored with antepartum testing starting at 41 weeks. After
41 weeks, there is an increasing risk that the placenta
cannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen and
nutrition. This may be reflected in decreased move-
ments of the baby, decreased amniotic fluid, and changes
in the heart rate pattern of the baby.
Description
Technology
The NST and CST use a technique called electronic
fetal monitoringto evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus.
The biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination.
NST
The NST is usually the first antepartum test used to
verify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle that
when the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.
The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring accel-
erations of the heart rate in response to the baby’s own
movements, i.e., in the absence of stress.
The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic fetal
monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the fetal
heart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on a
graph or “tracing” to determine whether it demonstrates
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	221
Antepartum testing
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 221  correct reactivity, or acceleration of the heart rate. To
record fetal movements on the tracing, the mother press-
es a button every time she feels the baby move. If the
baby is inactive, the mother may be asked to rub her
abdomen to “awaken” it. Sometimes an instrument is
used to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus (vibroa-
coustic stimulation). The test usually takes between
20–45 minutes.
A baby who is receiving enough oxygen should
move at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s
heart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute for
at least 20 seconds during these movements. The NST is
the simplest and cheapest antepartum test.
Biophysical profile
The biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that
can add additional information to the NST. During the
biophysical profile, the examiner checks for various
characteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall health.
These include: fetal movement, fetal tone, breathing
movements, and the amniotic fluid volume. Amniotic
fluid volume is important because a decreased amount
raises the possibility that the baby may be under stress.
The five components of the test (NST is also included)
are each given a score of 2 for normal (or present), 1 if
decreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possible
score is 10. The “modified” biophysical profile is
another option; this includes only the NST and amniotic
fluid volume.
CST
The CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is
evaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s
uterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often
used after an abnormal NST to confirm the results. Uter-
ine contractions produce “stress” in the fetus because
they temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen. The
CST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond to
this stress by a decrease in the heart rate.
The CST is performed with the same equipment as
the NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate are
recorded along with the onset, relative intensity, and
duration of any spontaneous contractions. For an accu-
rate test, the contractions should be of sufficient duration
and frequency. If uterine activity does not occur natural-
ly, a drug called oxytocin may be given to the mother
intravenously (hence the test’s alternate name, the oxy-
tocin challenge test) to provoke contractions. Another
option is self-stimulation of the mother’s nipples,
because this releases natural oxytocin. The fetal heart
rate is observed until, ideally, three moderate contrac-
tions occur within 10 minutes.	Preparation
The mother should eat just before the antepartum
tests to help stimulate fetal activity.
Risks
There are no appreciable risks from the NST or the
biophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysical
profile is painless and safe because it uses no harmful
radiation, and no evidence has been found that sound
waves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus.
The frequency of antepartum testing depends on the
reason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give incor-
rect results, which may prompt an unnecessary early
delivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important to dou-
ble-check any abnormal findings.
Normal results
In general, “negative” or normal results on antepar-
tum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthy
and should remain so for perhaps a week, with no need
for immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the tests cannot
guarantee that there are no problems, because falsely
normal results can occur, though this is unusual. Even if
all test results are normal, it is important to realize that
this does not guarantee a “perfect” baby.
The NST is normal (“reactive”) if two or more dis-
tinct fetal movements occur in association with appropri-
ate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within 20 minutes.
A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassur-
ing. The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelera-
tions in heart rate in response to three uterine contrac-
tions within 10 minutes.
Abnormal results
A “positive” result suggests that the baby is not
receiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it is
quite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal.
To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder, follow-up
testing with the same or an alternate test will probably be
performed at least weekly.
The NST is abnormal (“nonreactive”) if the fetal
heart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per minute
at least two times during a 20-minute period. Abnormal
decreases in the heart rate (decelerations) are also a cause
for concern.
A biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a
cause for concern and should be followed by further test-
ing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate delivery
of the fetus.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 222  Abnormal results on the CST include late decelera-
tions, or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate after the
uterine contractions. This can suggest that the baby is not
receiving enough oxygen and may have difficulty with-
standing the stress of labor and vaginal delivery. Cesare-
an sectionmight be necessary so the baby can be spared
the stress of labor. With either NST or CST, a severe
deceleration (a period of very slow heartbeat) can also
suggest fetal distress.
The ultimate outcome will depend on the woman’s
individual situation. In some cases, delivery can be post-
poned while medication is given to the mother (e.g., for
high blood pressure) or the fetus (e.g., to speed up lung
maturity before delivery). Depending upon the readiness
of the mother’s cervix, the doctor may decide to induce
labor. The extra-large fetus of a diabetic woman may
require cesarean delivery; severe preeclampsia also may
necessitate induction of laboror cesarean section. The
doctor will determine the most prudent course of action.

Anthrax
Definition
Anthrax is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus
anthracisthat primarily affects livestock but that can
occasionally spread to humans, affecting either the skin,
intestines, or lungs. In humans, the infection can often be
treated, but it is almost always fatal in animals.
Description
Anthrax is most often found in the agricultural
areas of South and Central America, southern and east-
ern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle
East. In the United States, anthrax is rarely reported,
however, cases of animal infection with anthrax are
most often reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and its
associated disease get their name from the Greek word
meaning “coal” because of the characteristic coal-black
sore that is the hallmark of the most common form of
the disease.
During the 1800s, in England and Germany, anthrax
was known either as “wool-sorter’s” or “ragpicker’s” dis-
ease because workers contracted the disease from bacter-
ial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibers.
Spores are the small, thick-walled dormant stage of some
bacteria that enable them to survive for long periods of
time under adverse conditions. The first anthrax vaccine
was perfected in 1881 by Louis Pasteur.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	223
Anthrax
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 223  The largest outbreak ever recorded in the United
States occurred in 1957 when nine employees of a goat
hair processing plant became ill after handling a contam-
inated shipment from Pakistan. Four of the five patients
with the pulmonary form of the disease died. Other cases
appeared in the 1970s when contaminated goatskin
drumheads from Haiti were brought into this country as
souvenirs. Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle,
largely because of widespread animal vaccination. How-
ever, some serious epidemics continue to occur among
animal herds and in human settlements in developing
countries due to ineffective control programs.
There has been a great deal of recent concern that
the bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by some
countries as a type of biological warfare, since it is possi-
ble to become infected simply by breathing in the spores.
The largest-ever documented outbreak of human anthrax
contracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in
1979, when anthrax spores were released from a military
laboratory, causing a regional epidemic that killed 69 of
its 77 victims. Because the United States government
considers anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, the
Department of Defense has begun systematic vaccination
of all military personnel against anthrax, and other
nations, such as Britain, are rapidly following suit.
Causes and symptoms
Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus
anthracis, which produces spores that can remain dor-
mant for years in soil and on animal products, such as
hides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal to
cattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and bones
are often heavily contaminated.
Today, in humans, the disease is almost always an
occupational hazard, contracted by those who handle
animal hides (farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or
sort wool. It is also possible to become infected with
anthrax by eating meat from contaminated animals.
There are no reports of the disease spreading from one
person to another.
Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was
contracted, but the symptoms usually appear within one
week of exposure.
Cutaneous anthrax
In humans, anthrax usually occurs when the bacteria
enter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infec-
tion at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this infection is
called, is the mildest form of the disease. At first, the
bacteria cause an itchy, raised area like an insect bite.
Within one to two days, inflammation occurs around the
raised area, and a blister forms around an area of dying
tissue that becomes black in the center. Other symptoms
may include shivering and chills. In most cases the bacte-
ria remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to the
nearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into the
bloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi-
soningthat rapidly proves fatal.
Inhalation anthrax
Inhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to a
rare, fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary or
inhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimes
spreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-
like symptoms, namely fever,fatigue,headache, and
shortness of breath, but progresses to bronchitis, dur-
ing which time it becomes difficult to breathe, and final-
ly, the patient enters a state of shock. This rare form of
anthrax is usually fatal, even if treated within one or two
days after the symptoms appear.
Intestinal anthrax
Intestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the dis-
ease, caused by eating meat from an animal that died of
anthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinal
inflammation and sores or lesions (ulcers), much like the
sores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form of
anthrax. The first signs of the disease are nausea and
vomiting, loss of appetite, and fever, followed by abdomi-
nal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe bloody diarrhea.
Diagnosis
Anthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracisin
samples taken from blood,skin lesions, or respiratory
secretions. The bacteria may be positively identified
using biochemical methods or using a technique where-

made to fluoresce. Blood samples will also indicate ele-
vated antibody levels or increased amounts of a protein
produced directly in response to infection with the
anthrax bacterium. Additional DNA-based tests are also
currently being perfected.
Treatment
In the early stages, anthrax is curable by administering
high doses of penicillin, but in the advanced stages, it can
be fatal. Other commonly used antibiotics, such as ery-
thromycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, are also effec-
tive, particularly for those individuals who are allergic to
penicillin. Although not proven, it is thought that newer
antibiotics, like ciprofloxacin and some cephalosporins,
may also prove effective. Although cutaneous anthrax may
be cured following a single dose of antibiotic, it is impor-
tant to continue treatment so as to avoid potential serious
complications, such as inflammation of the membranes
covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
Prognosis
Untreated anthrax is often fatal, but deathis far less
likely with appropriate care. Ten to twenty percent of
patients will die from anthrax of the skin (cutaneous
anthrax) if it is not properly treated. All patients with
inhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will die if untreated.
Intestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75% of the time.
Prevention
Anthrax is relatively rare in the United States
because of widespread animal vaccination and practices
used to disinfect hides or other animal products. For
those in high-risk professions, an anthrax vaccine is
available that is 93% effective in protecting against infec-
tion. To provide this immunity, an individual must be
given an initial course of three injections, given two
weeks apart, followed by booster injections at 6, 12, and
18 months and an annual immunization thereafter.
Approximately 30% of those who have been vacci-
nated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions,
such as a slight tenderness at the injection site. Someone
who has already had anthrax might have a more severe
local reaction upon vaccination. Infrequently, there may
be a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of the
forearm, and only a very few vaccine recipients may
have a more general flu-like reaction to the shot.
Other means of preventing the spread of infection
include carefully handling dead animals suspected of
having the disease and providing good ventilation when
processing hides, fur, wool, or hair. Whether this vaccine

Antiacne drugs
Definition
Antiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up pim-
ples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe forms of
acne.
Purpose
Different types of antiacne drugs are used for differ-
ent purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels, and
creams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may be
used to clear up mild to moderately severe acne.
Isotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for very
severe, disfiguring acne.
Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or
hair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxy
material, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles.
Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair to
form a protective coating, but when it cannot get out,
small swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteria
and dead skin cells can also collect that can cause
inflammation. Swellings that are small and not
inflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When they
become inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples that
fill with pus are called pustules.
Acne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help clear
the skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildly
irritating the skin. This encourages skin cells to slough
off, which helps open blocked pores. Benzoyl peroxide
also kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads and
blackheads from turning into pimples. Isotretinoin
shrinks the glands that produce sebum.
Description
Benzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counter
acne products that are applied to the skin, such as
Benoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne, PanOxyl,
and some formulations of Clean & Clear, Clearasil, and
Oxy. Some benzoyl peroxide products are available with-
out a physician’s prescription; others require a prescrip-
tion. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available only with a physi-
cian’s prescription and comes in liquid, cream, and gel
forms, which are applied to the skin. Isotretinoin (Accu-
tane), which is taken by mouth in capsule form, is avail-
able only with a physician’s prescription. Only physicians
who have experience in diagnosing and treating severe
acne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
anti-acne drug. These drugs usually come with written
directions for patients and should be used only as direct-
ed. Patients who have questions about how to use the
medicine should check with a physician or pharmacist.
Patients who use isotretinoin usually take the medi-
cine for a few months, then stop for at least two months.
Their acne may continue to improve even after they stop
taking the medicine. If the condition is still severe after
several months of treatment and a two-month break, the
physician may prescribe a second course of treatment.
Precautions
Isotretinoin
Isotretinoin can cause serious birth defects, includ-
ing mental retardationand physical deformities. This
medicine should not be used during pregnancy. Women
who are able to bear children should not use isotretinoin
unless they have very severe acne that has not cleared up
with the use of other anti-acne drugs. In that case, a
woman who uses this drug must have a pregnancy test
two weeks before beginning treatment and each month
they are taking the drug. Another pregnancy test must be
done one month after treatment ends. The woman must
use an effective birth control method for one month
before treatment begins and must continue using it
throughout treatment and for one month after treatment
ends. Women who are able to bear children and who want
to use this medicine should discuss this information with
their health care providers. Before using the medicine,
they will be asked to sign a consent form stating that they
understand the danger of taking isotretinoin during preg-
nancy and that they agree to use effective birth control.
Do not donate blood to a blood bank while taking
isotretinoin or for 30 days after treatment with the drug
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2226
Antiacne drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 226  ends. This will help reduce the chance of a pregnant
woman receiving blood containing isotretinoin, which
could cause birth defects.
Isotretinoin may cause a sudden decrease in night
vision. If this happens, do not drive or do anything else
that could be dangerous until vision returns to normal.
Let the physician know about the problem.
This medicine may also make the eyes, nose, and
mouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eye
drops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve the
dry mouth, chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarless
candy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which come
in liquid and tablet forms and are available without a pre-
scription. If the problem continues for more than two
weeks, check with a physician or dentist. Mouth dryness
that continues over a long time may contribute to tooth
decayand other dental problems.
Isotretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.
Patients being treated with this medicine should avoid
exposure to the sun and should not use tanning beds, tan-
ning booths, or sunlamps until they know how the drug
affects them.
In the early stages of treatment with isotretinoin,
some people’s acne seems to get worse before it starts
getting better. If the condition becomes much worse or if
the skin is very irritated, check with the physician who
prescribed the medicine.
Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin
When applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be careful
not to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or inside of
the nose. Do not put the medicine on skin that is wind
burned, sunburned, or irritated, and do not apply it to
open wounds.
Because antiacne drugs such as benzoyl peroxide
and tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing any-
thing that might cause further irritation. Wash the face
with mild soap and water only two or three times a day,
unless the physician says to wash it more often. Avoid
using abrasive soaps or cleansers and products that might
dry the skin or make it peel, such as medicated cosmet-
ics, cleansers that contain alcohol, or other acne products
that contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acid.
If benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin make the skin too
red or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with a
physician. Using the medicine less often or using a
weaker strength may be necessary.
Tretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight. While
being treated with this medicine, avoid exposure to the sun
and do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.
If it is not possible to avoid being in the sun, use a sun-
screen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 or
wear protective clothing over the treated areas. The skin
may also become more sensitive to cold and wind. People
who use this medicine should protect their skin from cold
and wind until they know how the medicine affects them.
Benzoyl peroxide may discolor hair or colored fab-
rics.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines may have problems if they
use antiacne drugs. Before using these products, be sure to
let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to etretinate, isotretinoin, tretinoin, vitamin A prepara-
tions, or benzoyl peroxide in the past should let his or her
physician know before using an antiacne drug. The
physician should also be told about any allergiesto
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with a physician before
using tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Isotretinoin causes
birth defects in humans and must not be used during
pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING.No problems have been reported
in nursing babies whose mothers used tretinoin or ben-
zoyl peroxide. Women who are breastfeeding babies
should not take isotretinoin, however, as it may cause
problems in nursing babies.

any of these medical problems should make sure their
physicians are aware of their conditions:
• alcoholism or heavy drinking, now or in the past
• diabetes (or family history of diabetes). Isotretinoin
may also change blood sugar levels.
• family history of high triglyceride levels in the blood
• severe weight problems
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Using antiacne drugs
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects

Minor discomforts such as dry mouth or nose, dry
eyes, dry skin, or itchingusually go away as the body
adjusts to the drug and do not require medical attention
unless they continue or are bothersome.
Other side effects should be brought to a physicians
attention. These include:
• burning, redness, or itching of the eyes
• nosebleeds
• signs of inflammation of the lips, such as peeling, burn-

Antiangina drugs
Definition
Antiangina drugs are medicines that relieve the
symptoms of anginapectoris (severe chest pain).
Purpose
The dull, tight chest pain of angina occurs when the
heart’s muscular wall is not getting enough oxygen. By
relaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce the
heart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen-
rich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come in
different forms, and are used in three main ways:
• taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the
number of angina attacks.
• taken just before some activity that usually brings on an
attack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.
• taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain and
pressure.
Not every form of antiangina drug can be used in
every way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks that
are about to begin or to relieve attacks that have already
started. These forms can be used only to reduce the num-
ber of attacks. Be sure to understand how and when to
use the type of antiangina drug that has been prescribed.
Description
Antiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in
many different forms: tablets and capsules that are swal-
lowed; tablets that are held under the tongue, inside the
lip, or in the cheek until they dissolve; stick-on patches;
ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays. Commonly used
antiangina drugs include isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil,
Sorbitrate, and other brands) and nitroglycerin (Nitro-
Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual Spray, Nitrostat Tablets,
Transderm-Nitro, and other brands). These medicines are
available only with a physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type and
form of antiangina drug and may be different for differ-
ent patients. Check with the physician who prescribed
the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for
the correct dosage.
Always take antiangina drugs exactly as directed.
The medicine will not work if it is not taken correctly.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-
ing it for several weeks or more, as this could cause angi-

drug, check with the physician who prescribed it for
instructions on how to taper down gradually.
Precautions
Remember that some forms of antiangina drugs
work too slowly to relieve attacks that have already start-
ed. Check with the physician who prescribed the medi-
cine for instructions on how to use the type that has been
prescribed. Patients who are using slower-acting forms to
make attacks less frequent may want to ask their physi-
cians to prescribe a fast-acting type to relieve attacks.
Another method of treating the frequency of attacks is to
increase the dosage of the long-acting antiangina drug.
Do this only with the approval of a physician.
These medicines make some people feel lighthead-
ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lying
down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and hold
onto something for support if possible. Antiangina drugs
may also cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintingin
hot weather or when people stand for a long time or
exercise. Use caution in all these situations. Drinking
alcohol while taking antiangina drugs may cause the
same problems. Anyone who takes this medicine should
limit the amount of alcohol consumed.
Because these drugs may cause dizziness, be careful
when driving, using machines, or doing anything else
that could be dangerous.
If the person is taking the form of nitroglycerin that
is placed under the tongue and symptoms are not relieved
within three doses taken about 5 minutes apart, the per-
son should go to the hospital emergency room as soon as
possible. A heart attackmay be in progress.
Some people develop tolerance to antiangina drugs
over time. That is, the drug no longer produces the
desired effects. Anyone who seems to be developing a
tolerance to this medicine should check with his or her
physician.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antiangina
drugs in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should also
be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
before using antiangina drugs.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of antiangina drugs and thus more likely to have
side effects such as dizziness and lightheadedness.
Before using antiangina drugs, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-
cians are aware of their conditions:
• recent heart attack or stroke
• kidney disease
• liver disease
• severe anemia
• overactive thyroid
• glaucoma
• recent head injury
Side effects
A common side effect is a headachejust after taking
a dose of the medicine. These headaches usually become
less noticeable as the body adjusts to the drug. Check
with a physician if they are severe or they continue even
after taking the medicine for a few weeks. Unless a
physician says to do so, do not change the dose to avoid

Antianxiety drugs
Definition
Antianxiety drugs are medicines that calm and relax
people with excessive anxiety, nervousness, or tension,
or for short term control of social phobia disorder or spe-
cific phobia disorder.
Purpose
Antianxiety agents, or anxiolytics, may be used to
treat mild transient bouts of anxiety as well as more pro-
nounced episodes of social phobia and specific phobia.
Clinically significant anxiety is marked by several
KEY TERMS
Angina pectoris—A feeling of tightness, heavi-
ness, or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxy-
gen in the muscular wall of the heart.
symptoms. The patient experiences marked or persistent
fear of one or more social or performance situations in
which he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or pos-
sible scrutiny by others, and may react in a humiliating
or embarrassing way. The exposure to the feared situa-
tion produces an anxiety attack. Fear of these episodes
of anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairs
normal social functioning, including working or attend-
ing classes. The patient is aware that these fears are
unjustified.
Description
In psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has
largely turned from traditional antianxiety agents, anxi-
olytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current use, the
benzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics,
have been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reup-
take inhibitors (SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxam-
ine and others) which have a milder side effect profile
and less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxi-
olytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onset
of action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety pro-
voking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need for
continued treatment. While SSRIs may require three to
five weeks to show any effects, and must be taken contin-
uously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within
30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.
The intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo-
lam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriate
choice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia.
Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, but
its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which has a
long half-life, may make this a poorer choice than other
drugs in its class. Note that there is considerable varia-
tion between individuals in metabolism of benzodi-
azepines, so patient response may not be predictable. As
a class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics,
but also as sedatives,muscle relaxants, and in treatment
of epilepsy and alcoholism. The distinctions between
these uses are largely determined by onset and duration
of action, and route of administration.
Buspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically related
to other classes of central nervous system drugs, is also a
traditional anxiolytic, although it is now considered
either a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trials
of SSRIs and benzodiazepines. It is appropriate for use in
patients who have either failed trials of other treatments,
or who should not receive benzodiazepines because of a
history of substance abuse problems. Buspirone, in com-
mon with antidepressants, requires a two to three week
period before there is clinical evidence of improvement,
and must be continuously dosed to maintain its effects.

Antianxiety drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 231  Benzodiazepines are controlled drugs under federal
law. Buspirone is not a controlled substance and has no
established abuse potential.
Recommended dosage
Benzodiazepines should be administered 30 to 60
minutes before exposure to the anticipated stress.
Dosage should be individualized to minimize sedation.
The normal dose of alprazolam is 0.25–0.5 mg. The
usual dose of lorazepam is 2–3 mg. Doses may be repeat-
ed if necessary.
Buspirone is initially dosed at 5 mg t.i.d. (3 times a
day.) Increase the dosage 5 mg/day, at intervals of two to
three days, as needed. Do not exceed 60 mg/day. Two to
three weeks may be required before a satisfactory response
is seen.
Precautions
Benzodiazepines should not be used in patients with
psychosis, acute narrow angle glaucoma, or liver dis-
ease. The drugs can act as respiratory depressants and
should be avoided in patients with respiratory conditions.
Benzodiazepines are potentially addictive and should not
be administered to patients with substance abuse disor-
ders. Because benzodiazepines are sedative, they should
be avoided in patients who must remain alert. Their use
for periods over four months has not been documented.
These drugs should not be used during the second and
third trimester of pregnancy, although use during the
first trimester appears to be safe. They should not be
taken while breastfeeding. Consult specialized references
for use in children.
Buspirone is metabolized by the liver and excreted
by the kidney, and should be used with care in patients
with hepatic or renal disease. The drug is classified as
schedule B during pregnancy, but should not be taken
during breastfeeding. Its use in children under the age of
18 years has not been studied.
Side effects
The most common side effects of benzodiazepines are
secondary to their CNS effects and include sedation and
sleepiness; depression; lethargy; apathy; fatigue; hypoac-
tivity; lightheadedness; memory impairment; disorienta-
tion; anterograde amnesia; restlessness; confusion; crying
or sobbing; delirium; headache; slurred speech; aphonia;
dysarthria; stupor; seizures; coma; syncope; rigidity;
tremor; dystonia; vertigo; dizziness; euphoria; nervous-
ness; irritability; difficulty in concentration; agitation;
inability to perform complex mental functions; akathisia;
hemiparesis; hypotonia; unsteadiness; ataxia; incoordina-
tion; weakness; vivid dreams; psychomotor retardation;
“glassy-eyed” appearance; extrapyramidal symptoms;
paradoxical reactions. Other reactions include changes in
heart rate and blood pressure, changes in bowel function,
severe skin rash and changes in genitourinary function.
Other adverse effects have been reported.
Buspirone has a low incidence of side effects. Dizzi-
ness and drowsiness are the most commonly reported
adverse effects. Other CNS effects include dream distur-
bances; depersonalization, dysphoria, noise intolerance,
euphoria, akathisia, fearfulness, loss of interest, disasso-
ciative reaction,hallucinations, suicidal ideation,
seizures; feelings of claustrophobia, cold intolerance,
stupor and slurred speech, psychosis. Rarely, heart prob-
lems, including congestive heart failureand myocardial
infarction, have been reported. Other adverse effects
have been reported.

Antiarrhythmic drugs
Definition
Antiarrhythmic drugs are medicines that correct irreg-
ular heartbeats and slow down hearts that beat too fast.
KEY TERMS
Anxiety—Worry or tension in response to real or
imagined stress, danger, or dreaded situations.
Physical reactions, such as fast pulse, sweating,
trembling, fatigue, and weakness may accompany
anxiety.
Epilepsy—A brain disorder with symptoms that
include seizures.
Panic disorder—An disorder in which people have
sudden and intense attacks of anxiety in certain
situations. Symptoms such as shortness of breath,
sweating, dizziness, chest pain, and extreme fear
often accompany the attacks.
Phobia—An intense, abnormal, or illogical fear of
something specific, such as heights or open spaces.
Pregnancy category B—Animal studies indicate
no fetal risk, but no human studies; or adverse
effects in animals, but not in well-controlled
human studies.
Pregnancy category C—No adequate human or
animal studies; or adverse fetal effects in animal
studies, but no available human data.
Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.
Purpose
Normally, the heart beats at a steady, even pace. The
pace is controlled by electrical signals that begin in one part
of the heart and quickly spread through the whole heart. If
something goes wrong with this control system, the result
may be an irregular heartbeat, or an arrhythmia. Antiar-
rhythmic drugs correct irregular heartbeats, restoring the
normal rhythm. If the heart is beating too fast, these drugs
will slow it down. By correcting these problems, antiar-
rhythmic drugs help the heart work more efficiently.
Description
Antiarrhythmic drugs are available only with a
physician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regular
and extended release), tablet (regular and extended-
release), and injectable forms. Commonly used antiar-
rhythmic drugs are disopyramide (Norpace, Norpace
CR), procainamide (Procan SR, Pronestyl, Pronestyl-
SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin, Duraquin, Quinidex,
and other brands). Do not confuse quinidine with qui-
nine, which is a related medicine with different uses, such
as relieving leg cramps.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be dif-
ferent for different patients. Check with the physician
who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the
prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take antiarrhythmic drugs exactly as direct-
ed. Never take larger or more frequent doses.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it. Stopping it sudden-
ly could lead to a serious change in heart function.
Antiarrhythmic drugs work best when they are at
constant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,
take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the day
and night. Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine at
night interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult to remem-
ber to take the medicine during the day, check with a
health care professional for suggestions.
Precautions
Persons who take these drugs should see their physi-
cian regularly. The physician will check to make sure the
medicine is working as it should and will note any
unwanted side effects.
Some people feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when
using these drugs. This medicine may cause blurred

Antiarrhythmic drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 233  vision or other vision problems. Because of these possi-
ble problems, anyone who takes these drugs should not
drive, use machines or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the drugs affect
them. If the medicine does cause vision problems, wait
until vision is clear before driving or engaging in other
activities that require normal vision.
Antiarrhythmic drugs make some people feel light-
headed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or
lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and
hold onto something for support if possible.
Anyone taking this medicine should not drink alco-
hol without his or her physician’s approval.
Some antiarrhythmic drugs may change the results
of certain medical tests. Before having medical tests,
anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care
professional in charge.
Anyone who is taking antiarrhythmic drugs should
be sure to tell the health care professional in charge
before having any surgical or dental procedures or
receiving emergency treatment.
Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause low blood sugar in
some people. Anyone who experiences symptoms of low
blood sugar should eat or drink a food that contains sugar
and call a physician immediately. Signs of low blood
sugar are:
• anxiety
• confusion
• nervousness
• shakiness
• unsteady walk
• extreme hunger
• headache
• nausea
• drowsiness
• unusual tiredness or weakness
• fast heartbeat
• pale, cool skin
• chills
• cold sweats
Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause dry mouth. To
temporarily relieve the discomfort, chew sugarless gum,
suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva substi-
tutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and are
available without a prescription. If the problem continues
for more than 2 weeks, check with a physician or dentist.
Mouth dryness that continues over a long time may con-
tribute to tooth decayand other dental problems.
People taking antiarrhythmic drugs may sweat less,
which can cause the body temperature to rise. Anyone
who takes this medicine should be careful not to become
overheated during exerciseor hot weather and should
avoid hot baths, hot tubs, and saunas. Overheating could
lead to heat stroke.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. This may increase the
risk of certain side effects, such as dry mouth, difficult
urination, and dizzinessor lightheadedness.
The antiarrhythmic drug procainamide can cause
serious blood disorders. Anyone taking this medicine
should have regular blood counts and should check with
a physician if any of the following symptoms occur:
• joint or muscle pain
• muscle weakness
• pain in the chest or abdomen
• tremors
• wheezing
• cough
• palpitations
• rash, sores, or pain in the mouth
• sore throat
• fever and chills
• loss of appetite
•diarrhea
• dark urine
• yellow skin or eyes
• unusual bleeding or bruising
• dizziness
•hallucinations
• depression
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are tak-
ing certain other medicines may have problems if they take
antiarrhythmic drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sure to
let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to an antiarrhythmic drug in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking this type of medicine
again. Patients taking procainamide should let their
physicians know if they have ever had an unusual or
allergic reaction to procaine or any other “caine-type”
medicine, such as xylocaine or lidocaine. Patients taking
quinidine should mention any previous reactions to qui-

giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
CONGESTIVE HEART DISEASE.Antiarrhythmic drugs
may cause low blood sugar, which can be a particular
problem for people with congestive heart disease. Any-
one with congestive heart disease should be familiar with
the signs of low blood sugar (listed above) and should
check with his or her physician about what to do if such
symptoms occur.
DIABETES.Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause low
blood sugar, which can be a particular problem for peo-
ple with diabetes. Anyone with diabetes should be famil-
iar with the signs of low blood sugar (listed above) and
should check with his or her physician about what to do
if such symptoms occur.
PREGNANCY.The effects of taking antiarrhythmic
drugs in pregnancyhave not been studied in humans. In
studies of laboratory animals, this medicine increased the
risk of miscarriage. In addition, some women who have
taken these drugs while pregnant have had contractions
of the uterus (womb). Women who are pregnant or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
before taking this medicine. Women who become preg-

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking antiarrhythmic
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dry mouth and
throat, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. These problems
usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do
not require medical treatment. Less common side effects,
such as dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, dry
eyes and nose, frequent urge to urinate, bloating,consti-
pation, stomach pain, and decreased sexual ability, also
may occur and do not need medical attention unless they
do not go away or they interfere with normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with the physician who prescribed the medicine as soon
as possible:
• fever and chills
• difficult urination
• swollen or painful joints
• pain when breathing
• skin rash or itching
People who are especially sensitive to quinidine may
have a reaction to the first dose or doses. If any of these
side effects occur after taking quinidine, check with a
physician immediately:
• dizziness
• ringing in the ears
• breathing problems
• vision changes
•fever
• headache
• skin rash
Other rare side effects may occur with any antiar-
rhythmic drug. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after
taking antiarrhythmic drugs should get in touch with his
or her physician.
Interactions
Antiarrhythmic drugs may interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes antiarrhythmic drugs should
let the physician know all other medicines he or she is
taking. Among the drugs that may interact with antiar-
rhythmic drugs are:
• other heart medicines, including other antiarrhythmic
drugs
• blood pressure medicine
• blood thinners
• pimozide (Orap), used to treat Tourette’s syndrome
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with antiarrhythmic drugs. Be sure to check with
a physician or pharmacist before combining antiarrhyth-
mic drugs with any other prescription or nonprescription
(over-the-counter) medicine.

Antiasthmatic drugs
Definition
Antiasthmatic drugs are medicines that treat or pre-
vent asthmaattacks.
Purpose
For people with asthma, the simple act of breathing
can be a struggle. Their airways become inflamed and
blocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing the
opening through which air passes. This is not such a prob-
lem when the person breathes in, because the airways nat-
urally expand when a person takes a breath. The real prob-
lem arises when the person with asthma tries to breathe
out. The air cannot get out through the blocked airways, so
it stays trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, the
person can take in only a little more air, so breathing
becomes shallow and takes more and more effort.
Asthma attacks can be caused by allergiesto pollen,
dust, pets or other things, but people without known
allergies may also have asthma. Exercise,stress, intense
emotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines and some
medical conditions also can bring on attacks.
The two main approaches to dealing with asthma are
avoiding substances and situations that trigger attacks
and using medicines that treat or prevent the symptoms.
With a combination of the two, most people with asthma
can find relief and live normal lives.
Description
Three types of drugs are used in treating and pre-
venting asthma attacks:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2236
Antiasthmatic drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 236  •Bronchodilatorsrelax the smooth muscles that line the
airway. This makes the airways open wider, letting
more air pass through them. These drugs are used main-
ly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to prevent attacks
that might come on after exercise. They may be taken
by mouth, injected or inhaled.
•Corticosteroidsblock the inflammation that narrows
the airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help pre-
vent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will be
less severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop an
attack that is already underway. These drugs may be
taken by mouth, injected or inhaled.
• Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthma
attacks and may be used alone or with other asthma
medicines. It cannot stop an attack that already has
started. The drug works by preventing certain cells in
the body from releasing substances that cause allergic
reactions or asthma symptoms. One brand of this
drug, Nasalcrom, comes in capsule and nasal spray
forms and is used to treat hay feverand other aller-
gies. The inhalation form of the drug, Intal, is used for
asthma. It comes in aerosol canisters, in capsules that
are inserted into an inhaler, and in liquid form that is
used in a nebulizer.
Precautions
Using antiasthmatic drugs properly is important.
Because bronchodilators provide quick relief, some peo-
ple may be tempted to overuse them. However, with
some kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to serious
and possibly life-threatening complications. In the long
run, patients are better off using bronchodilators only as
directed and also using corticosteroids, which eventually
will reduce their need for bronchodilators.
Patients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs cor-
rectly but feel their asthma is not under control should
see their physicians. The physician can either increase
the dose, switch to another medicine or add another med-
icine to the regimen.
Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that may cause
serious side effects when used over a long time. However,
these problems are much less likely with the inhalant
forms than with the oral and injected forms. While the
oral and injected forms generally should be used only for
one to two weeks, the inhalant forms may be used for
long periods.
When used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolyn
must be taken as directed every day. The drug may take
as long as four weeks to start working. Unless told to do
so by a physician, patients should not stop taking the
drug just because it does not seem to be working. When
symptoms do begin to improve, patients should continue
taking all medicines that have been prescribed, unless a
physician directs otherwise.
Side effects
Inhalant forms of antiasthmatic drugs may cause
dryness or irritation in the throat,dry mouth, or an
unpleasant taste in the mouth. To help prevent these
problems, gargle and rinse the mouth or take a sip of
water after each dose.
More serious side effects are not common when
these medicines are used properly. However, anyone who

Antibiotic-associated colitis
Definition
Antibiotic-associated colitis is an inflammation of
the intestines that sometimes occurs following antibiotic
treatment and is caused by toxins produced by the bac-
terium Clostridium difficile.
Description
Antibiotic-associated colitis, also called antibiotic-
associated enterocolitis, can occur following antibiotic
treatment. The bacteria Clostridia difficileare normally
found in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but peo-
ple can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hos-
pital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless resi-
dent intestinal bacteria compete with each other for food
and places to “sit” along the inner intestinal wall. When
antibioticsare given, most of the resident bacteria are
KEY TERMS
Asthma—A disease in which the air passages of
the lungs become inflamed and narrowed.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or ill-
ness.
Inhalant—Medicine that is breathed into the
lungs.
Mucus—Thick fluid produced by the moist mem-
branes that line many body cavities and structures.
Nebulizer—A device that turns liquid forms of
medicine into a fine spray that can be inhaled.
killed. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the normally
harmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and produce
toxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of the
intestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea.
Although all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is
most commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi-
cillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, or
Wymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such as
cefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition can
occur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeks
after the treatment has stopped.
In approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associated
colitis, the condition progresses to a more severe form of
colitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in which
pseudomembranes are excreted in the stools. Pseudomem-
branes are membrane-like collections of white blood cells,
mucus, and the protein that causes blood to clot (fibrin)
that are released by the damaged intestinal wall.
Causes and symptoms
Antibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins pro-
duced by the bacterium Clostridium difficileafter treat-
ment with antibiotics. When most of the other intestinal
bacteria have been killed,Clostridium difficilegrows
rapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinal
wall. The disease and symptoms are caused by these tox-
ins, not by the bacterium itself.
Symptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually
begin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment has
begun. The early signs and symptoms of this disease
include lower abdominal cramps, an increased need to
pass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progress-
es, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,
fatigue, abdominal pain, and fever. If the disease pro-
ceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patient
may also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts of
watery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105°F/40-
40.5°C). Complications of antibiotic-associated colitis
include severe dehydration, imbalances in blood miner-
als, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin
(edema), enlargement of the large intestine (toxic mega-
colon), and the formation of a tear (perforation) in the
wall of the large intestine.
Clostridium difficileis easily spread from person to
person in hospitals and nursing homes. The following
individuals are most at-risk for developing this disease:
• the elderly
• severely ill individuals
• individuals with weakened or suppressed immune sys-
tems (immunocompromised)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2238
Antibiotic-associated colitis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 238  • individuals with poor hygiene
• individuals who have been hospitalized for a long peri-
od of time
The Clostridium difficiletoxin is found in the stools
of persons older than 60 years of age 20-100 times more
frequently than in the stools of persons who are 10-20
years old. As a result, the elderly are much more prone to
developing antibiotic-associated colitis than younger
individuals.
Diagnosis
Antibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by the
symptoms and recent medical history of the patient, by a
laboratory test for the bacterial toxin, and/or by using a
procedure called endoscopy.
If the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after
the patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated col-
itis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzed
for the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. This
toxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic-
associated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxin
involves adding the processed stool sample to a human
cell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, the
cells die. It may take up to two days to get the results
from this test. A simpler test, which provides results in
two to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxin
test results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.
Another tool that may be useful in the diagnosis of
antibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedure
called an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin, lighted
tube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lin-
ing. Two different types of endoscopy procedures, the
sigmoidoscopyand the colonoscopy, are used to view
different parts of the large intestine. These procedures
are performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients are
sedated during the procedure to make them more com-
fortable and are allowed to go home after recovering
from the sedation.
Treatment
Diarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated
by encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids and
prevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-asso-
ciated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic that
caused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bac-
teria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the over-
growth of Clostridium difficile. Many patients with mild
disease respond well to this and are free from diarrhea
within two weeks. It is important, however, to make sure
that the original disease for which the antibiotics were
prescribed is treated.
KEY TERMS
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon.
Edema—Fluid accumulation in a tissue.
Endoscopy—A procedure in which a thin, lighted
instrument is inserted into the interior of a hollow
organ, such as the rectum and used to visually
inspect the inner intestinal lining.
Fibrin—A fibrous blood protein vital to coagula-
tion and blood clot formation.
Rectum—The last part of the intestine. Stool pass-
es through the rectum and out through the anal
opening.
Toxic megacolon—Acute enlargement or dilation
of the large intestine.
Because of the potential seriousness of this disease,
most patients are given another antibiotic to control the
growth of the Clostridium difficile, usually vancomycin
(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Both
are designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14
days. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately
15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of diarrhea
within one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go untreated
with great success, however, severe relapses of diarrhea
require another round of antibiotic treatment. Instead of
further antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine resin
(Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial tox-
ins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and are
passed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,
however, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so these
two drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious dis-
ease may require hospitalization so that the patient can
be monitored, treated, and rehydrated.
Alternative treatment
The goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-asso-
ciated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal envi-
ronment with microorganisms that are normal and
healthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansisms
then compete for space and keep the Clostridium difficile
from over-populating.
Several types of supplements can be used. Supple-
ments containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, the bacteria
commonly found in yogurt and some types of milk,Lacto-
bacillus bifidus, and Streptococcus faecium, are available
in many stores in powder, capsule, tablet, and liquid form.
Acidophilus also acts as a mild antibiotic, which helps it to

production of some B vitaminsand vitamin K. These sup-
plements can be taken individually and alternated weekly
or together following one or more courses of antibiotics.
Prognosis
With appropriate treatment and replenishment of
fluids, the prognosis is generally excellent. One or more
relapses can occur. Very severe colitis can cause a tear
(perforation) in the wall of the large intestine that would
require major surgery. Perforation of the intestine can
cause a serious abdominal infection. Antibiotic-associat-
ed colitis can be fatal in people who are elderly and/or
have a serious underlying illness, such as cancer.
Prevention
There are no specific preventative measures for this
disease. Good general health can reduce the chance of
developing a bacterial infection that would require
antibiotic treatment and the chance of picking up the
Clostridiabacteria. Maintaining good general health can
also reduce the seriousness and length of the condition,
should it develop following antibiotic therapy.

Antibiotics
Definition
Antibiotics may be informally defined as the sub-
group of anti-infectives that are derived from bacterial
sources and are used to treat bacterial infections. Other
classes of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides, may be
effective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics may
have secondary uses, such as the use of demeclocycline
(Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syn-
drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
secretion. Other antibiotics may be useful in treating pro-
tozoal infections.
Purpose
Antibiotics are used for treatment or prevention of
bacterial infection.
Description
Classifications
Although there are several classification schemes for
antibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad versus nar-
row) or route of administration (injectable versus oral ver-
sus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriosta-
tic), the most useful is based on chemical structure. Antibi-
otics within a structural class will generally show similar
patterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential.
PENICILLINS.The penicillinsare the oldest class of
antibiotics, and have a common chemical structure which
they share with the cephalopsorins. The two groups are
classed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and are generally
bacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria rather than
inhibiting growth. The penicillins can be further subdi-
vided. The natural pencillins are based on the original
penicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant penicillins,
notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active even in the
presence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates most
natural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillin
and amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of action
compared with the natural penicillins; extended spectrum
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2240
Antibiotics
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 240  penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria.
These generally include coverage for Pseudomonas
aeruginaosaand may provide the penicillin in combina-
tion with a penicillinase inhibitor.
CEPHALOSPORINS.Cephalosporinsand the closely
related cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pen-
cillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure. Conse-
quently, there are patterns of cross-resistance and cross-
allergenicity among the drugs in these classes. The
“cepha” drugs are among the most diverse classes of
antibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped into 1st, 2nd
and 3rd generations. Each generation has a broader spec-
trum of activity than the one before. In addition, cefox-
itin, a cephamycin, is highly active against anaerobic
bacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominal
infections. The 3rd generation drugs, cefotaxime, cefti-
zoxime, ceftriaxone and others, cross the blood-brain
barrier and may be used to treat meningitisand
encephalitis. Cephalopsorins are the usually preferred
agents for surgical prophylaxis.
FLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn-
thetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria.
They are included here because they can be readily inter-
changed with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, related
class of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were not
well absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinary
tract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based on
the older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal drugs
that are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or the
cephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone tis-
sue, and so well absorbed that in general they are as
effective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.
TETRACYCLINES.Tetracyclinesgot their name
because they share a chemical structure that has four
rings. They are derived from a species of Streptomyces
bacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, the
tetracyclines may be effective against a wide variety
of microorganisms, including rickettsia and amebic
parasites.
MACROLIDES.The macrolide antibiotics are derived
from Streptomycesbacteria, and got their name because
they all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structure.
Erythromycin, the prototype of this class, has a spectrum
and use similar to penicillin. Newer members of the
group, azithromycin and clarithyromycin, are particular-
ly useful for their high level of lung penetration. Clar-
ithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacter
pyloriinfections, the cause of stomach ulcers.
OTHERS.Other classes of antibiotics include the
aminoglycosides, which are particularly useful for their
effectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosainfec-
tions; the lincosamindes, clindamycin and lincomycin,
which are highly active against anaerobic pathogens.
There are other, individual drugs which may have utility
in specific infections.
Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, route of administration,
pathogen, site of infection, and severity. Additional con-
siderations include renal function, age of patient, and
other factors. Consult manufacturers’ recommendations
for dose and route.
Side effects
All antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by non-sus-
ceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major hazards
by class; however, the health care provider should review
each drug individually to assess the degree of risk. Gen-
erally, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking
antibiotics because of risk of alteration to infant’s intesti-
nal flora, and risk of masking infection in the infant.
Excessive or inappropriate use may promote growth of
resistant pathogens.
Penicillins: Hypersensitivity may be common, and
cross allergenicity with cephalosporins has been reported.
Penicillins are classed as category B during pregnancy.
Cephalopsorins: Several cephalopsorins and related
compounds have been associated with seizures. Cefmeta-
zole, cefoperazone, cefotetan and ceftriaxone may be

been reported with cephalosporins and other broad spec-
trum antibiotics. Some drugs in this class may cause

Fluroquinolones: Lomefloxacin has been associated
with increased photosensitivity. All drugs in this class
have been associated with convulsions. Pregnancy cate-
gory C.
Tetracyclines: Demeclocycline may cause increased
photosensitivity. Minocycline may cause dizziness. Do
not use tetracyclines in children under the age of eight,
and specifically avoid during periods of tooth develop-
ment. Oral tetracyclines bind to anions such as calcium
and iron. Although doxycycline and minocycline may be
taken with meals, patients must be advised to take other
tetracycline antibiotics on an empty stomach, and not to
take the drugs with milk or other calcium-rich foods.
Expired tetracycline should never be administered. Preg-
nancy category D. Use during pregnancy may cause
alterations in bone development.
Macrolides: Erythromycin may aggravate the weak-
ness of patients with myasthenia gravis. Azithromycin
has, rarely, been associated with allergic reactions,
including angioedema,anaphylaxis, and dermatologic
reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and
toxic epidermal necrolysis. Oral erythromycin may be
highly irritating to the stomach and when given by injec-
tion may cause severe phlebitis. These drugs should be
used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction.
Pregnancy category B: Azithromycin, erythromycin.
Pregnancy category C: Clarithromycin, dirithromycin,
troleandomycin.
Aminoglycosides: This class of drugs causes kidney
and ototoxicity. These problems can occur even with
normal doses. Dosing should be based on renal function,
with periodic testing of both kidney function and hear-
ing. Pregnancy category D.
Recommended usage
To minimize risk of adverse reactions and develop-
ment of resistant strains of bacteria, antibiotics should be
restricted to use in cases where there is either known or a
reasonable presumption of bacterial infection. The use of
antibiotics in viral infections is to be avoided. Avoid use
of fluroquinolones for trivial infections.
In severe infections, presumptive therapy with a
broad-spectrum antibiotic such as a 3rd generation
cephalosporin may be appropriate. Treatment should be
changed to a narrow spectrum agent as soon as the

Ophthalmic antibioticsare medicines that kill bac-
teria that cause eye infections.
KEY TERMS
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause
many diseases and infections.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Meningitis—Inflammation of tissues that surround
the brain and spinal cord.

fetal effects in animal studies, but no available
human data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,
but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence
of fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.
Purpose
Ophthalmic antibiotics are applied to the eye, or
under the eyelid, to treat eye infections caused by bacteria.
Description
The medicine described here, tobramycin (Tobrex),
comes in the form of eye drops or ointment. It is avail-
able only with a physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The dosages given here are typical doses. Physicians
may adjust the number of doses per day, the time
between doses, and the length of treatment with the med-
icine, depending on the patient’s particular medical prob-
lem. If the physician’s directions are different from those
given here, follow the physician’s directions.
Be sure to follow package directions for applying
drops or ointment properly.
Adults
EYE DROPS.For mild to moderate infections, use one
to two drops in the affected eye or eyes every four hours.
For severe infections, use two drops in the affected
eye or eyes every two hours until the condition improves.
At that time, the physician will determine how much to
use until the infection is completely cleared up.
OINTMENT.For mild to moderate infections,
squeeze a half-inch ribbon of ointment into the affected
eye or eyes two or three times a day. Do not let the tip of
the ointment tube touch the eye.
For severe infections, squeeze a half-inch ribbon of
ointment into the affected eye or eyes every three to four
hours until the condition improves. At that time, the
physician will determine how much to use until the
infection is completely cleared up.
Children
The child’s physician should determine the proper
dose.
Precautions
Use this drug as often as directed, for as long as
directed. Although the symptoms may have disap-
peared, the infection may not clear up completely if the
drug is stopped too soon. Therefore, the medication
may be prescribed for several days after the infection
appears to have cleared. However, it is just as important
to use the drug for onlyas long as directed. Using it for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	243
Antibiotics, ophthalmic
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 243  too long may lead to the growth of bacteria that do not
respond to the drug. These bacteria may then cause
infections that can be very difficult to treat. Make sure
the physician or pharmacist specifies how long the
medication is to be used.
Anyone who has had an allergic reaction to
tobramycin or any other ingredients of Tobrex should not
use this medicine. Be sure to tell the physician about any
past reactions to the drug or its ingredients.
Anyone who has an allergic reaction to tobramycin
should stop using it immediately and call a physician.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
plan to become pregnant should check with their physi-
cians before using tobramycin.
Side effects
The main side effects of this medicine are itching,
redness, and swelling of the eye or eyelid. Allergic reac-
tions also are possible. If any of these symptoms occur,
call the physician who prescribed the medicine.
Interactions
Patients who are using any other prescription or non-
prescription (over-the-counter) medicines in their eyes
should check with their physicians before using
tobramycin.

Antibiotics, topical
Definition
Topical antibioticsare medicines applied to the skin
to kill bacteria.
KEY TERMS
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause
many diseases and infections.
Ointment—A thick, spreadable substance that
contains medicine and is meant to be used on the
skin, or, if it is specifically an ophthalmic, or “eye”
ointment, in the eye
Purpose
Topical antibiotics help prevent infections caused by
bacteria that get into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.
Treating minor woundswith antibiotics allows quicker
healing. If the wounds are left untreated, the bacteria will
multiply, causing pain, redness, swelling,itching, and
oozing. Untreated infections can eventually spread and
become much more serious.
Different kinds of topical antibiotics kill different
kinds of bacteria. Many antibiotic first-aid products con-
tain combinations of antibiotics to make them effective
against a broad range of bacteria.
When treating a wound, it is not enough to simply
apply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be cleaned
with soap and water and patted dry. After the antibiotic is
applied, the wound should be covered with a dressing,
such as a bandage or a protective gel or spray. For many
years, it was thought that wounds heal best when exposed
to the air. But now most experts say it is best to keep
wounds clean and moist while they heal. The covering
should still allow some air to reach the wound, however.
Description
Some topical antibiotics are available without a pre-
scription and are sold in many forms, including creams,
ointments, powders, and sprays. Some widely used topi-
cal antibiotics are bacitracin, neomycin, mupirocin, and
polymyxin B. Among the products that contain one or
more of these ingredients are Bactroban (a prescription
item), Neosporin, Polysporin, and Triple Antibiotic Oint-
ment or Cream.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
topical antibiotic. Follow the directions on the package
label or ask a pharmacist for directions.
In general, topical antibiotics should be applied
within four hours after injury. Do not use more than the
recommended amount and do not apply it more often
than three times a day. Do not apply the medicine over
large areas of skin or on open wounds.
Precautions
Many public health experts are concerned about
antibiotic resistance, a problem that can develop when
antibiotics are overused. Over time, bacteria develop new
defenses against antibiotics that once were effective
against them. Because bacteria reproduce so quickly,
these defenses can be rapidly passed on through genera-
tions of bacteria until almost all are immune to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2244
Antibiotics, topical
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 244  effects of a particular antibiotic. The process happens
faster than new antibiotics can be developed. To help
control the problem, many experts advise people to use
topical antibiotics only for short periods, that is, until the
wound heals, and only as directed. For the topical antibi-
otic to work best, it should be used only to prevent infec-
tion in a fresh wound, not to treat an infection that has
already started. Wounds that are not fresh may need the
attention of a physician to prevent complications such as
blood poisoning.
Topical antibiotics are meant to be used only on the
skin and only for only a few days at a time. If the wound
has not healed in five days, stop using the antibiotic and
call a doctor.
Do not use topical antibiotics on large areas of skin
or on open wounds. These products should not be used to
treat diaper rashin infants or incontinence rash in
adults.
Only minor cuts, scrapes, and burns should be treat-
ed with topical antibiotics. Certain kinds of injuries may
need medical care and should not be self-treated with
topical antibiotics. These include:
• large wounds
• deep cuts
• cuts that continue bleeding
• cuts that may need stitches
• burns any larger than a few inches in diameter
• scrapes imbedded with particles that won’t wash away
• animal bites
• deep puncture wounds
• eye injuries
Never use regular topical antibiotics in the eyes.
Special antibiotic products are available for treating eye
infections.
Although topical antibiotics control infections
caused by bacteria, they may allow fungal infections to
develop. The use of other medicines to treat the fungal
infections may be necessary. Check with the physician or
pharmacist.
Some people may be allergic to one or more ingredi-

Anticancer drugs
Definition
Anticancer, or antineoplastic, drugs are used to treat
malignancies, cancerous growths. Drug therapy may be
used alone, or in combination with other treatments such
as surgery or radiation therapy.
Purpose
Anticancer drugs are used to control the growth of
cancerous cells. Canceris commonly defined as the
uncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiation
and commonly, with metastasis, spread of the cancer to
other tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths.
In contrast, benign growths remain encapsulated and grow
within a well-defined area. Although benign tumors may
be fatal if untreated, due to pressure on essential organs, as
in the case of a benign brain tumor, surgery or radiation
are the preferred methods of treating growths which have a
well defined location. Drug therapy is used when the
tumor has spread, or may spread, to all areas of the body.
Description
Several classes of drugs may be used in cancer treat-
ment, depending on the nature of the organ involved. For
example, breast cancers are commonly stimulated by
estrogens, and may be treated with drugs which inactive
the sex hormones. Similarly,prostate cancermay be
treated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sex
hormone. However, the majority of antineoplastic drugs

erection of the penis.
act by interfering with cell growth. Since cancerous cells
grow more rapidly than other cells, the drugs target those
cells which are in the process of reproducing themselves.
As a result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affect
not only the cancerous cells, but others cells that com-
monly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles, ovaries
and testis, and the blood-forming organs.
Newer approaches to antineoplastic drug therapy
have taken different approaches, including angigenesis—
the inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding the
tumor and contributing to tumor growth. Although these
approaches hold promise, they are not yet in common use.
Antineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class-
es: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle specific
drugs act only at specific points of the cell’s duplication
cycle, such as anaphase or metaphase, while non-cycle
specific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle. In
order to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs are
commonly used in combinations.
Precautions
Because antineoplastic agents do not target specific
cell types, they have a number of common adverse side
effects. Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair fol-
licles, and anemia, immune system impairment, and clot-
ting problems are caused by destruction of the blood form-
ing organs, leading to reduction in the number of red cells,
white cells, and platelets. Because of the frequency and
severity of these side effects, it is common to administer
chemotherapyin cycles, allowing time for recovery from
the drug effects before administering the next dose. Doses
are often calculated, not on the basis of weight, but rather
based on blood counts, in order to avoid dangerous levels
of anemia (red cell depletion),neutropenia(white cell
deficiency), or thrombocytopenia(platelet deficiency.)
Nausea and vomitingare among the most common
adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy, and in some
cases may be severe enough to cause dose reduction or
discontinuation of treatment.
The health professional has many responsibilities in
dealing with patients undergoing chemotherapy. The
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2246
Anticancer drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 246  patient must be well informed of the risks and benefits of
chemotherapy, and must be emotionally prepared for the
side effects. These may be permanent, and younger
patients should be aware of the high risk of sterility after
chemotherapy.
The patient must also know which side effects
should be reported to the practitioner, since many
adverse effects do not appear until several days after a
dose of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is self-
administered, the patient must be familiar with proper
use of the drugs, including dose scheduling and avoid-
ance of drug-drug and food-drug interactions.
Appropriate steps should be taken to minimize side
effects. These may include administration of antinause-
ant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, main-
taining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly to
the kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduce
blood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due to
drug therapy.
Patients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk of
infections due to reduced white blood counts. While pro-
phylactic antibioticsmay be useful, the health care pro-
fessional should also be sure to use standard precautions,
including gowns and gloves when appropriate. Patients
should be alerted to avoid risks of viral contamination,
and live virus immunizations are contraindicated until
the patient has fully recovered from the effects of
chemotherapy. Similarly, the patient should avoid contact
with other people who have recently had live virus
immunizations.
Other precautions which should be emphasized are
the risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because antineo-
plastic drugs are commonly harmful to the fetus, women
of childbearing potential should be cautioned to use two
effective methods of birth control while receiving cancer
chemotherapy. This also applies if the woman’s male
partner is receiving chemotherapy. Breastfeeding should
be avoided while the mother is being treated.
Before prescribing or administering anticancer
drugs, health care providers should inquire whether the
patient has any of the following conditions:
•chickenpoxor recent exposure to someone with chick-
enpox
• shingles (Herpes zoster)
• mouth sores
• current or past seizures

Anticoagulant and
antiplatelet drugs
Definition
Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent clot forma-
tion or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlarging.
They inhibit clot formation by blocking the action of
clotting factors or platelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall into
three categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis,
inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.
Purpose
Anticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood
to form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to pre-
vent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots inside
the blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organs
and cause heart attacks and strokes. Although these drugs
are sometimes called blood thinners, they do not actually
thin the blood. Furthermore, this type of medication will
not dissolve clots that already have formed, although the
drug stops an existing clot from worsening. However,
another type of drug, used in thrombolytic therapy, will
dissolve existing clots.
Anticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi-
tions. For example, they may be given to prevent blood
clots from forming after the replacement of a heart valve
or to reduce the risk of a strokeor another heart attack
after a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce the
chance of blood clots forming during open heart surgery
or bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may be
given to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay in
bed for a long time after certain types of surgery.
Because anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability to
clot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding and
heavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these drugs
exactly as directed and to see a physician regularly as
long as they are prescribed.
Description
Anticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugs
or blood thinners, are available only with a physician’s
prescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms.
They fall into three groups:
• Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagu-
lants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors in
the liver. One example is warfarin (brand name:	coumadin).
• Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interfere
with blood clotting by blocking the activity of throm-
bin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan).
• Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact with
platelets, which is a type of blood cell, to block
platelets from aggregating into harmful clots. They
include:aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plav-
ix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
anticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which it
is prescribed. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist
who filled the prescription can provide information con-
cerning the correct dosage. Usually, the physician will
adjust the dose after checking the patient’s clotting time.
Anticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct-
ed by the physician. Larger or more frequent doses
should not be taken, and the drug should also not be
taken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of this
medication can cause severe bleeding.Anticoagulants
should also be taken on schedule. A record of each dose
should be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it should
be taken as soon as possible followed by the regular dose
schedule. However, a patient who forgets to take a
missed dose until the next day should not take the missed
dose at all and should not double the next dose, as this
could lead to bleeding. A record of all missed doses
should be kept for the prescribing physician who should
be informed at the scheduled visits.
Precautions
Persons who take anticoagulants should see a physi-
cian regularly while taking these drugs, particularly at
the beginning of therapy. The physician will order peri-
odic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. The
results of these tests will help the physician determine
the proper amount of medication to be taken each day.
Time is required for normal clotting ability to return
after anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patients
must observe the same precautions they observed while
taking the drug. The length of time needed for the blood
to return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulant
drug that was taken. The prescribing physician will advise
as to how long the precautions should be observed.
People who are taking anticoagulant drugs should
tell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other med-
ical professionals who provide medical treatments or ser-
vices to them that they are taking such a medication.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 250  They should also carry identification stating that they are
using an anticoagulant drug.
Other prescription drugs or over-the-counter medi-
cine—especially aspirin—should be not be taken without
the prescribing physician being informed.
Because of the risk of heavy bleeding, anyone who
takes an anticoagulant drug must take care to avoid
injuries. Sports and other potentially hazardous activities
should be avoided. Any falls, blows to the body or head,
or other injuries should be reported to a physician, as
internal bleeding may occur without any obvious symp-
toms. Special care should be taken in shaving and in
brushing and flossing the teeth. Soft toothbrushes should
be used and the flossing should be very gentle. Electric
razors should be used instead of a blade.
Alcohol can change the way anticoagulant drugs
affect the body. Anyone who takes this medicine should
not have more than one to two drinks at any time and
should not drink alcohol every day.
Special conditions
People with specific medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take anticoagulant drugs. Before taking these drugs, the
prescribing physician should be informed about any of
these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to anticoagulants in the past should let his or her physi-
cian know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergiesto beef, pork, or
other foods; dyes; preservatives; or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Anticoagulants may cause many seri-
ous problems if taken during pregnancy. Birth defects,
severe bleeding in the fetus, and other problems that
affect the physical or mental development of the fetus or
newborn are possible. The mother may also experience
severe bleeding if she takes anticoagulants during preg-
nancy, during delivery, or even shortly after delivery.
Women should not take start taking anticoagulants dur-
ing pregnancy and should not become pregnant while
taking it. Any woman who becomes pregnant or suspects
that she has become pregnant while taking an anticoagu-
lant should check with her physician immediately.
BREASTFEEDING.Some anticoagulant drugs may
pass into breast milk. Blood tests can be done on nursing
babies to see whether the drug is causing any problems.
If it is, other medication may be prescribed to counteract
the effects of the anticoagulant drug.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-
coagulant drugs, people should inform their physician
about anymedical problems they have. They should also
let the physician who prescribed the medicine know if
they are being treated by any other medical physician or
dentist. In addition, people who will be taking anticoagu-
lant drugs should let their physician know if they have
recently had any of the following:
•feverlasting more than one to two days
• severe or continuing diarrhea
• childbirth
• heavy or unusual menstrual bleeding
• insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)
• falls, injuries, or blows to the body or head
• any type of surgery, including dental surgery
• spinal anesthesia
• radiation treatment
USE OF CERTAIN FOODS AND MEDICINES. Many
foods and drugs may affect the way the anticoagulant
drugs work or may increase the risk of side effects.
Side effects
The most common minor side effects are bloating or
gas. These problems usually go away as the body adjusts
to the drug and do not require medical treatment.
More serious side effects may occur, especially if
excessive anticoagulant is taken. If any of the following
side effects occur, a physician should be notified imme-
diately:
• bleeding gums
• sores or white spots in the mouth or throat
• unusual bruisesor purplish areas on the skin
• unexplained nosebleeds
• unusually heavy bleeding or oozing from wounds
• unexpected or unusually menstrual bleeding
• blood in the urine
• cloudy or dark urine
• painful or difficult urination or sudden decrease in

• black, tarry, or bloody stools
• coughing up blood
• vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee

or she is taking—even aspirin, laxatives, vitamins, and
antacids.
Diet also affects the way anticoagulant drugs work
in the body. A normal, balanced diet should be followed
every day while taking such medication. No dietary
changes should be made without informing first the pre-
scribing physician, who should also be told of any illness
or other condition interfering with the ability to eat nor-
mally. Diet is a very important consideration because the
amount of vitamin K in the body affects how anticoagu-
lant drugs work. Dicoumarol and warfarin act by reduc-
ing the effects of vitamin K. Vitamin K is found in meats,
dairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multi-
ple vitaminsand nutritional supplements. For the drugs
to work properly, it is best to have the same amount of
vitamin K in the body all the time. Foods containing vita-
min K in the diet should not be increased or decreased
without consulting with the prescribing physician. If the
patient takes vitamin supplements, he should check the
label to see if it contains vitamin K. Because vitamin K is
also produced by intestinal bacteria, a severe case of
diarrhea or the use of laxativesmay also alter a person’s
vitamin K levels.

Anticonvulsant drugs
Definition
Anticonvulsant drugs are medicines used to prevent
or treat convulsions (seizures).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2252
Anticonvulsant drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 252  Purpose
Anticonvulsant drugs are used to control seizures in
people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is not a single disease—it
is a set of symptoms that may have different causes in
different people. The common thread is an imbalance in
the brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causes
seizures that may affect part or all of the body and may
or may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsant
drugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severi-
ty of seizures.
Some cases of epilepsy are brought on by head
injuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic prob-
lems such as low blood sugar. But in some people with
epilepsy, the cause is not clear.
Anticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the
treatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of drugs
may be prescribed for different types of seizures. In addi-
tion to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy should get
enough rest, avoid stress, and practice good health habits.
Some physicians believe that giving the drugs to
children with epilepsy may prevent the condition from
getting worse in later life. However, others say the effects
are the same, whether treatment is started early or later in
life. Determining when treatment begins depends on the
physician and his assessment of the patient’s symptoms.
Physicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsant
drugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorder
and migraine headaches.
Description
Anticonvulsant drugs may be divided into several
classes. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) and
mephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include etho-
suximide (Zarontin)and methsuccimide (Celontin.) The
benzodiazepines, which are better known for their use as
tranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam
(Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam (Vali-
um.) There are also a large number of other drugs which
are not related to larger groups. These include carba-
mazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote, Depak-
ene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), fel-
bamate (Felbatol) and several others. Phenobarbital has
been used as an anticonvulsant, and is still useful for
some patients. The drugs are available only with a physi-
cian’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liquid,
and “sprinkle” forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
anticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures for
which it is being taken. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-
scription for the correct dosage.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-
ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the
dose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects.
Do not change brands or dosage forms of this medi-
cine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If a
prescription refill does not look like the original medicine,
check with the pharmacist who filled the prescription.
Precautions
Patients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a physi-
cian regularly while on therapy, especially during the
first few months. The physician will check to make sure
the medicine is working as it should and will note
unwanted side effects. The physician may also need to
adjust the dosage during this period.
Valproic acid can cause serious liver damage, espe-
cially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children are par-
ticularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine should
see their physician regularly for tests of liver function and
should be alert to symptoms of liver damage, such as yel-
low skin and eyes, facial swelling, loss of appetite, gener-
al feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liver
problems are suspected, call a physician immediately.
Felbatol has caused serious liver damage and aplas-
tic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow stops
producing blood cells. Patients taking this drug should
have regular blood counts, and should stop taking the
drug if there are too few red blood cells.
While taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start or
stop taking any other medicines without checking with a
physician. The other medicines may affect the way the
anticonvulsant medicine works.
Because anticonvulsant drugs work on the central
nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol
and other drugs that slow down the central nervous sys-
tem, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy
medicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tran-
quilizers, some painrelievers, and muscle relaxants.
Anyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check with
his or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking any
medicines that slow the central nervous system.
Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicines
used during surgery, dental procedures, or emergency
treatment. These interactions could increase the chance
of side effects. Anyone who is taking anticonvulsant
drugs should be sure to tell the health care professional in
charge before having any surgical or dental procedures or
receiving emergency treatment.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 253  Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less
alert when using these drugs, especially when they first
begin taking them or when their dosage is increased.
Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs should not drive,
use machines or do anything else that might be danger-
ous until they have found out how the drugs affect them.
Anticonvulsant drugs may affect the results of certain
medical tests. Before having medical tests, people who
take anticonvulsant drugs should make sure that the med-
ical professional in charge knows what they are taking.
Children may be more likely to have certain side
effects from anticonvulsant drugs, such as behavior
changes; tender, bleeding, or swollen gums; enlarged
facial features; and excessive hair growth. Problems with
the gums may be prevented by regularly brushing and
flossing, massaging the gums, and having the teeth
cleaned every 3 months whether the patient is a child or
an adult.
Children who take high doses of this medicine for a
long time may have problems in school.
Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of
anticonvulsant drugs. This may increase the chance of
side effects and overdoses.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take anticonvulsant drugs. Before taking these drugs, be
sure to let the physician know about any of these condi-
tions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to anticonvulsant drugs or to tricyclic antidepressants
such as imipramine (Tofranil) or desipramine (Nor-
pramin) in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should also
be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Birth defectshave been reported in
babies born to mothers who took anticonvulsant drugs
during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
about the safety of using anticonvulsant drugs during
pregnancy.
Some anticonvulsant drugs taken during pregnancy
may cause bleeding problems in the mother during deliv-
ery and in the baby after delivery. This problem can be
avoided by giving vitamin K to the mother during deliv-
ery and to the baby after birth.
Pregnancy may affect the way the body absorbs anti-
convulsant drugs. Women who are prone to seizures may
have more seizures during pregnancy, even though they
are taking their medicine regularly. If this happens, they
should check with their physicians about whether the
dose needs to be increased.
BREASTFEEDING.Some anticonvulsant drugs pass
into breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in babies
whose mothers take the medicine. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians about
the benefits and risks of using anticonvulsant drugs.
DIABETES.Anticonvulsant drugs may affect blood
sugar levels. Patients with diabetes who notice changes
in the results of their urine or blood tests should check
with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-
convulsant drugs, people with any of these medical prob-
lems should make sure their physicians are aware of their
conditions:
• liver disease
• kidney disease
• thyroid disease
• heart or blood vessel disease
• blood disease
• brain disease
• problems with urination
• current or past alcohol abuse
• behavior problems
• diabetes mellitus
•glaucoma
• porphyria
• systemic lupus erythematosus
•feverhigher than 101°F (38.3°C) for more than 24
hours
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking anticonvulsant
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are constipation,
mild nausea or vomiting, and mild dizziness, drowsiness,
or lightheadedness. These problems usually go away as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment. Less common side effects, such as diarrhea,
sleep problems, aching joints or muscles, increased sen-
sitivity to sunlight, increased sweating, hair loss, enlarge-
ment of facial features, excessive hair growth, muscle
twitching, and breast enlargement in males also may

sist or are troublesome.
Other side effects may need medical attention. If any
of these side effects occur, check with a physician as
soon as possible:
• clumsiness or unsteadiness
• slurred speech or stuttering
• trembling
• unusual excitement, irritability, or nervousness
• uncontrolled eye movements
• blurred or double vision
• mood or mental changes
• confusion
• increase in seizures
• bleeding, tender, or swollen gums
• skin rash or itching
• enlarged glands in neck or armpits
• muscle weakness or pain
•fever
Other side effects are possible. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking anticonvulsant drugs
should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Some anticonvulsant drugs should not be taken
within two to three hours of taking antacidsor medicine
for diarrhea. These medicines may make the anticonvul-
sant drugs less effective. Ask the pharmacist or physician
for more information.
Birth control pills may not work properly when anti-
convulsant drugs are being taken. To prevent pregnancy,
ask the physician or pharmacist if additional methods of
birth control should be used while taking anticonvulsant
drugs.
Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with many other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs
should let the physician know all other medicines he or
she is taking. Among the drugs that may interact with
certain anticonvulsant drugs are:
• airway opening drugs (bronchodilators) such as
aminophylline, theophylline (Theo-Dur and other
brands), and oxtriphylline (Choledyl and other brands)
• medicines that contain calcium, such as antacids and
calcium supplements

Antidepressant drugs
Definition
Antidepressant drugs are medicines that relieve
symptoms of depressive disorders.
Purpose
Depressive disorders may be either unipolar (depres-
sion alone) or bipolar (depression alternating with peri-
ods of extreme excitation). The formal diagnosis requires
a cluster of symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. These
symptoms include, but are not limited to mood changes,
insomniaor hypersomnia, and diminished interest in
daily activities. The symptoms are not caused by any
medical condition, drug side effect, or adverse life event.
The condition is severe enough to cause clinically signif-
icant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.
Secondary depression, depression caused by unfa-
vorable life events, is normally self limiting, and may be
best treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy rather than
drugs.
Description
Antidepressant agents act by increasing the levels of
excitatory neurostransmitters. The main types of antide-
pressant drugs in use today are:
• tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),
imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)
•selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs or
serotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), parox-
etine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)
•monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors),
such as phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Par-
nate)
• tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants
which do not fall into any of the above categories
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev-
els of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in the
brain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. These
have become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychi-
atric disorders, primarily because of their low incidence
of severe side effects as compared with other drugs in
this therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions and
side effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action.
Tricyclic compounds, identified by their chemical
structure containing three carbon rings, are an older class
of antidepressants. Although generally effective, they
have a high incidence of anticholinergic effects, notably
dry mouthand dry eyes, which can cause discomfort.
They also cause cardiac arrythmias. Because tricyclics
act on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may have
some value in treatment of patients who fail to respond to
SSRIs. Drugs in this class are often available at low
prices, which may be significant when cost is a major
factor in treatment. They have also been found useful in
control of some neurologic painsyndromes.
Tricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary in
severity of side effects, most notably the degree of seda-
tionand the extent of the anticholinergic effects.
Tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants
are chemically distinct from both the major groups and
each other. Although maprotilene (no brand name, mar-
keted in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron)
are similar in chemical structures, they differ in their bal-
ance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine [Nardil],
tranylcypromine [Parnate]) have largely been supplanted
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2256
Antidepressant drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 256  in therapy because of their high risk of severe adverse
effects, most notably severe hypertension. They act by
inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which is
responsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neuro-
hormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and
serotonin. The MAOIs are normally reserved for patients
who are resistant to safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl
(Carbex, used in treatment of Parkinson’s disease) and
the herb,St. John’s wort, have some action against
monoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value as
anti-depressants. They do not share the same risks as the
non-selective MAO inhibitors.
All antidepressant agents, regardless of their struc-
ture, have a slow onset of action, typically three to five
weeks. Although adverse effects may be seen as early as
the first dose, significant therapeutic improvement is
always delayed. Similarly, the effects of antidepressants
will continue for a similar length of time after the drugs
have been discontinued.
Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the specific drug and patient. Con-
sult specialized references.
Precautions
Antidepressants have many significant cautions and
adverse effects. Although a few are listed here, specific
references should be consulted for more complete infor-
mation.
SSRIs. The most common side effect of SSRIs is exci-
tation and insomnia. Excitation has been reported in over
20% of patients, and insomnia in 33%. Significant weight
loss has been frequently reported, but most commonly in
patients who are already underweight. SSRIs may cause
some sedation, and patients should be cautioned not to per-
form tasks requiring alertness until they have evaluated the
effects of these drugs. SSRIs are pregnancycategory C
drugs. Most SSRIs are excreted in breast milk, and there
have been anecdotal reports of somnolence in infants
whose mothers were taking SSRIs while breastfeeding.
Tricyclic antidepressants. Amoxepine (not marketed
by brand, generic available), although a tricyclic antide-
pressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer),
displays some of the more serious effects of the neu-
roleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug induced
involuntary movements) and neuroleptic malignant syn-
drome, a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptoms
include high fever, altered mental status, irregular pulse
or blood pressure, and changes in heart rate. These
adverse effects have not been reported with other tri-
cyclic antidepressants.
The most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide-
pressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effects,
such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult urination. Alter-
ations in heartbeat are also common, and may progress to
congestive heart failure,stroke, and sudden death.
Tricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categories
C or D, although there have been no formal studies of the
drugs on fetal development. There are no studies of
effects on newborns, but some anecdotal reports of mal-
formations have resulted from animal studies. The drugs
are excreted in breast milk.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The greatest risk
associated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis which
may be fatal and most often occurs when the drugs are
taken with interacting foods or drugs. More common
adverse reactions may include low blood pressure and
slowing of heartbeat. Sedation and gastrointestinal distur-
bances are also common. MAOIs are in pregnancy cate-
gory C. Safety in breast feeding has not been established.

individual, there are no group patterns of adverse reac-
tions. Consult specific references.
Interactions
The antidepressants have many drug interactions,
some severe. Although a few are listed here, specific refer-
ences should be consulted for more complete information.
SSRIs should not be administered with MAOIs.
Allow a wash-out period of about four weeks before
switching from one class of drugs to the other. Allow five
weeks if switching from fluoxetine (Prozac) to an MAOI.
MAOIs have many interactions; however the best
known are those with foods containing the amino acid tyra-
mine. These include aged cheese, chianti wine, and many
others. Patients and providers should review the MAOI diet
restrictions before using or prescribing these drugs.
Because of the severity of MAOI interactions, all additions
to the patient’s drug regimen should be reviewed with care.
Tricyclic compounds have many interactions, and
specialized references should be consulted. Specifically
avoid other drugs with anticholinergic effects. Tricyclics
should not be taken with the antibioticsgrepafloxacin
and sprafloxacin, since the combination may cause seri-
ous heart arrythmias.
KEY TERMS
Cognitive behavioral therapy—A type of psy-
chotherapy in which people learn to recognize
and change negative and self-defeating patterns of
thinking and behavior.
Depression—A mental condition in which people
feel extremely sad and lose interest in life. People
with depression may also have sleep problems
and loss of appetite and may have trouble concen-
trating and carrying out everyday activities.
Pregnancy category—A system of classifying
drugs according to their established risks for use
during pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human
studies have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category
B: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no
human studies; or adverse effects in animals, but
not in well-controlled human studies. Category C:
No adequate human or animal studies; or adverse
fetal effects in animal studies, but no available
human data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,
Tricyclic compounds should not be taken with the
gastric acid inhibitor cimetidine (Tagamet), since this
increases the blood levels of the tricyclic compound.
Other acid inhibiting drugs do not share this interaction.
SSRIs interact with a number of other drugs which
act on the central nervous system. Use care in combining
these drugs with major or minor tranquilizers, or with
anti-epileptic agents such as phenytoin (Dilantin) or car-
bamazepine (Tegretol).

Antidepressants, tricyclic
Definition
Tricyclic antidepressants are medicines that relieve
mental depression.
Purpose
Since their discovery in the 1950s, tricyclic antide-
pressants have been used to treat mental depression. Like
other antidepressant drugs, they reduce symptoms such
as extreme sadness, hopelessness, and lack of energy.
Some tricyclic antidepressants are also used to treat
bulimia,cocainewithdrawal,panic disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorders, certain types of chronic pain, and
bed-wettingin children.
Description
Named for their three-ring chemical structure, tri-
cyclic antidepressants work by correcting chemical
imbalances in the brain. But because they also affect
other chemicals throughout the body, these drugs may
produce many unwanted side effects.
Tricyclic antidepressants are available only with a
physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,
liquid, and injectable forms. Some commonly used tri-
cyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline (Elavil),
desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), nor-
triptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil). Differ-
ent drugs in this family have different effects, and physi-
cians can choose the drug that best fits the patient’s symp-
toms. For example, a physician might prescribe Elavil for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2258

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 258  a person with depression who has trouble sleeping,
because this drug is more likely to make people feel calm
and sleepy. Other tricyclic antidepressants might be more
appropriate for depressed people with low energy.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on many factors,
including the patient’s age, weight, general health and
symptoms. The type of tricyclic antidepressant and its
strength also must be considered. Check with the physi-
cian who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take tricyclic antidepressants exactly as
directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and
do not take the drug for longer than directed. Do not stop
taking the medicine just because it does not seem to be
working. Several weeks may be needed for its effects to
be felt. Visit the physician as often as recommended so
that the physician can check to see if the drug is working
and to note for side effects.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-
ing it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the
dose may be necessary to reduce the chance of withdraw-
al symptoms.
Taking this medicine with food may prevent upset
stomach.
Precautions
The effects of this medicine may continue for three
to seven days after patients stop taking it. All precautions
should be observed during this period, as well as
throughout treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, when
taking these drugs. The drugs may also cause blurred
vision. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive,
use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous
until they have found out how the drugs affect them.
Because tricyclic antidepressants work on the central
nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol
and other drugs that cause drowsiness, such as antihista-
mines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medi-
cine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and
muscle relaxants. Anyone taking tricyclic antidepres-
sants should check with his or her physician before drink-
ing alcohol or taking any drugs that cause drowsiness.
These medicines make some people feel lighthead-
ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lying
down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and hold
onto something for support if possible.
Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with medi-
cines used during surgery, dental procedures, or emer-
gency treatment. These interactions could increase the
chance of side effects. Anyone who is taking tricyclic
antidepressants should be sure to tell the health care pro-
fessional in charge before having any surgical or dental
procedures or receiving emergency treatment.
These drugs may also change the results of medical
tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this
medicine should alert the health care professional in
charge.
This medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.
Even brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn
or a rash. While being treated with this tricyclic antide-
pressants, avoid being in direct sunlight, especially
between 10 
A.M. and 3 P.M.; wear a hat and tightly woven
clothing that covers the arms and legs; use a sunscreen
with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15; protect
the lips with a sun block lipstick; and do not use tanning
beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.
Tricyclic antidepressants may cause dry mouth. To
temporarily relieve the discomfort, chew sugarless gum,
suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva substi-
tutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and are
available without a prescription.
Children and older people are especially sensitive to
the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. This increased
sensitivity may increase the chance of side effects.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take tricyclic antidepressants. Before taking these drugs,
be sure to let the physician know about any of these con-
ditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to tricyclic antidepressants or to carbamazepine (Tegre-
tol), maprotiline (Ludiomil), or trazodone (Desyrel) in
the past should let his or her physician know before tak-
ing tricyclic antidepressants. The physician should also
be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Problems have been reported in babies
whose mothers took tricyclic antidepressants just before
delivery. Women who are pregnant or who may become
pregnant should check with their physicians about the
safety of using tricyclic antidepressants.
BREASTFEEDING.Tricyclic antidepressants pass into
breast milk and may cause drowsiness in nursing babies
whose mothers take the drugs. Women who are breast-

tricyclic antidepressants.
DIABETES.Tricyclic antidepressants may affect
blood sugar levels. Diabetic patients who notice changes
in blood or urine test results while taking this medicine
should check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using tri-
cyclic antidepressants, people with any of these medical
problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:
• current or past alcohol or drug abuse
• bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness)
• schizophrenia
• seizures (convulsions)
• heart disease
• high blood pressure
• kidney disease
• liver disease
• overactive thyroid
• stomach or intestinal problems
• enlarged prostate
• problems urinating
•glaucoma
•asthma
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking tricyclic anti-
depressants with certain other drugs may affect the way
the drugs work or may increase the chance of side
effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness,
drowsiness, dry mouth, unpleasant taste,headache, nau-
sea, mild tiredness or weakness, increased appetite or
craving for sweets, and weight gain. These problems
usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do
not require medical treatment. Less common side effects,
such as diarrhea, vomiting, sleep problems, sweating,
and heartburnalso may occur and do not need medical
attention unless they do not go away or they interfere
with normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with the physician who prescribed the medicine as soon
as possible:
• blurred vision
• eye pain
• confusion
•hallucinations
• fainting
• loss of balance
• swallowing problems
• difficulty speaking
• mask-like face
• shakiness or trembling
• nervousness or restlessness
• movement problems, such as shuffling walk, stiff arms
and legs, or slow movement
• decreased sexual ability
• fast or irregular heartbeat
• constipation
• problems urinating
Some side effects may continue after treatment with
tricyclic antidepressants has ended. Check with a physi-
cian if these symptoms occur:
• headache
• nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
• sleep problems, including vivid dreams
• unusual excitement, restlessness, or irritability
Interactions
Life-threatening reactions, such as extrememly high
blood pressure, may occur when tricyclic antidepressants
are taken with other antidepressants called monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (such as Nardil and Parnate).
Do not take tricyclic antidepressants within 2 weeks of
taking a MAO inhibitor. However, a patient can take an
MAO inhibitor immediately after tricyclic antidepressant
therapy is stopped by the physician. 
Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with many
other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or
both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects
may be greater. Anyone who takes tricyclic antidepres-
sants should let the physician know all other medicines
he or she is taking. Among the drugs that may interact
with tricyclic antidepressants are:
• Central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as
medicine for allergies, colds, hay fever, and asthma;
sedatives; tranquilizers; prescription pain medicine;
muscle relaxants; medicine for seizures; sleep aids;
barbiturates; and anesthetics.
• Diet pills

Antidiabetic drugs
Definition
Antidiabetic drugs are medicines that help control
blood sugar levels in people with diabetes mellitus
(sugar diabetes).
Purpose
Diabetes may be divided into type I and type II, for-
merly termed juvenile onset or insulin-dependent, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	261
Antidiabetic drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 261  maturity onset or non insulin-dependent. Type I is caused
by a deficiency of insulin production, while type II is
characterized by insulin resistance.
Treatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin
replacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a num-
ber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulin
resistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases in
insulin secretion, and others may be controlled by diet
and exercise. Drug therapy may be directed towards
increasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivi-
ty, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.
Description
Antidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups:
insulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,
biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.
Insulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsi-
ble for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types of
diabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivi-
ty remains and the condition can be treated with larger
doses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced by
recombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically identi-
cal to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin suspen-
sion, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations are
intended to extend the duration of action of insulin, and
permit glucose control over longer periods of time.
Sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolaza-
mide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act by
increasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pan-
crease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this class,
appears to have a useful secondary action in increasing
insulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],
miglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.
Rather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides and
complex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism does
not prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing the
peak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
are useful for either monotherapy or in combination ther-
apy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents.
Metformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem-
ber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepatic
glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of
glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and uti-
lization. Metformin may be used as monotherapy, or in
combination therapy with a sulfonylurea.
There are two members of the meglitinide class:
repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). The
mechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulate
insulin production. This activity is both dose dependent
and dependent on the presence of glucose, so that the
drugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low
blood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,
or in combination with metformin. The manufacturer
warns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina-
tion with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion.
Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)
and the members of the thiazolidinedione class. They act
by both reducing glucose production in the liver, and
increasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in muscle
cells. They do not increase insulin production. These
drugs may be used in combination with metoformin or a
sulfonylurea.
Recommended dosage
Dosage must be highly individualized for all antidia-
betic agents and is based on blood glucose levels which
must be taken regularly. Review specific literature.
Precautions
Insulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is
hypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a direct
overdose or an imbalance between insulin injection and
level of exercise and diet. This may also occur in the
presence of other conditions which reduce the glucose
load, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Treat-
ment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liq-
uid, although severe cases may require intravenous thera-
py. Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occur.
Insulin is classified as category B in pregnancy, and is
considered the drug of choice for glucose control during
pregnancy. Insulin glargine (Lantus), an insulin analog
which is suitable for once-daily dosing, is classified as
category C, because there have been reported changes in
the hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. The
reports are essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effect
relationship has been determined. Insulin is not recom-
mended during breast feeding because either low of high
doses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulin
administered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and rep-
resents no risk to the newborn.
Sulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause
hypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to these
drugs over time, and may require either dose adjustments
or a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions is
extensive, and includes central nervous system problems
and skin reactions, among others. Hematologic reactions,
although rare, may be severe and include aplastic ane-
miaand hemolytic anemia. The administration of oral
hypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increased
cardiovascular mortality as compared with treatment
with diet alone or diet plus insulin. The sulfonylureas are
classified as category C during pregnancy, based on ani-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2262
Antidiabetic drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 262  mal studies, although glyburide has not shown any harm
to the fetus and is classified as category B. Because there
may be significant alterations in blood glucose levels
during pregnancy, it is recommended that patients be
switch to insulin. These drugs have not been fully studied
during breast feeding, but it is recommended that
because their presence in breast milk might cause hypo-
glycemia in the newborn, breastfeeding be avoided while
taking sulfonylureas.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are generally well tol-
erated, and do not cause hypoglycemia. The most com-
mon adverse effects are gastrointestinal problems,
including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
These drugs are classified as category B in pregnancy.
Although there is no evidence that the drugs are harmful
to the fetus, it is important that rigid blood glucose con-
trol be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant
women should be switched to insulin. Alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors may be excreted in small amounts in breast
milk, and it is recommended that the drugs not be admin-
istered to nursing mothers.
Metformin causes gastrointestinal reactions in about
a third of patients. A rare, but very serious, reaction to
metformin is lactic acidosis, which is fatal in about 50%
of cases. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiple
medical problems, including renal insufficiency. The risk
may be reduced with careful renal monitoring, and care-
ful dose adjustments to metformin. Metformin is catego-
ry B during pregnancy. There have been no carefully
controlled studies of the drug during pregnancy, but there
is no evidence of fetal harm from animal studies. It is
important that rigid blood glucose control be maintained
during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be
switched to insulin. Animal studies show that metformin
is excreted in milk. It is recommended that metformin
not be administered to nursing mothers.
Meglitinides. These drugs are generally well tolerat-
ed, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The
drugs are classified as category C during pregnancy,
based on fetal abnormalities in rabbits given about 40
times the normal human dose. It is important that rigid
blood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy,
and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It is
not known whether the meglitinides are excreted in
human milk, but it is recommended that these drugs not
be given to nursing mothers.
Thiazolidinediones. These drugs are generally well
tolerated, however they are structurally related to an ear-
lier drug, troglitazone, which was associated with liver
function problems. It is strongly recommended that all
patients treated with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone have
regular liver function monitoring. The drugs are classi-
fied as pregnancy category C, based on evidence of inhi-
bition of fetal growth in rats given more than four times
the normal human dose. It is important that rigid blood
glucose control be maintained during pregnancy, and
pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It is not
known whether the thiazolidinediones are excreted in
human milk, however they have been identified in the
milk of lactating rats. It is recommended that these drugs
not be administered to nursing mothers.
Interactions
The sulfonylureas have a particularly long list of
drug interactions, several of which may be severe.
Review specific literature for these drugs.
The actions of oral hypoglycemic agents may be
strengthened by highly protein bound drugs, including
NSAIDs, salicylates,sulfonamides, chloramphenicol,
coumarins, probenecid, MAOIs, and beta blockers.
Review the specific literature of each drugs for pos-
sible drug-drug or food-drug interactions.

Antidiarrheal drugs
Definition
Antidiarrheal drugs are medicines that relieve diarrhea.
KEY TERMS
Blood sugar—The concentration of glucose in the
blood.
Glucose—A simple sugar that serves as the body’s
main source of energy.
Hormone—A substance that is produced in one
part of the body, then travels through the blood-
stream to another part of the body where it has its
effect.
Metabolism—All the physical and chemical
changes that occur in cells to allow growth and
maintain body functions. These include processes
that break down substances to yield energy and
processes that build up other substances necessary
for life.
Pregnancy category—A system of classifying
drugs according to their established risks for use
during pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human
studies have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category
B: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no
human studies; or adverse effects in animals, but
not in well-controlled human studies. Category C:
No adequate human or animal studies; or adverse
fetal effects in animal studies, but no available
human data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,
but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence
of fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.
Salicylates—A group of drugs that includes aspirin
and related compounds. Salicylates are used to
relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.
Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.
Purpose
Antidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some
of the symptoms that go along with it. An average,
healthy person has anywhere from three bowel move-
ments a day to three a week, depending on that person’s
diet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in a
bowel movement) has a texture something like clay. With
diarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent, and
the texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery.
Diarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some other
problem. The symptom may be caused by eating or drink-
ing food or water that is contaminated with bacteria, virus-
es, or parasites, or by eating something that is difficult to
digest. People who have trouble digesting lactose (milk
sugar), for example, may get diarrhea if they eat dairy
products. Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress,
while others are brought on by taking certain medicines.
Description
Antidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The drug
loperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example, slows
the passage of stools through the intestines. This allows
more time for water and salts in the stools to be
absorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta-
pulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing sub-
stances from the digestive tract. However, they may also
pull out substances that the body needs, such as
enzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate, the ingre-
dient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion of fluid
into the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria. It
not only controls diarrhea, but relieves the cramps that
often accompany diarrhea.
These medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and
chewable tablet forms and can be bought without a
physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug.
Read and follow the directions on the product label. For
questions about dosage, check with a physician or phar-
macist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do
not take the drug for longer than directed.
Precautions
Diarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If the
problem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back, diarrhea
could be a sign of a more serious problem. Anyone who
has any of the symptoms listed below should get medical
attention as soon as possible:
• diarrhea that lasts more than two days or gets worse
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2264
Antidiarrheal drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 264  •fever
• blood in the stool
• vomiting
• cramps or tenderness in the abdomen
• Signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination,
dizzinessor lightheadedness,dry mouth, increased
thirst, or wrinkled skin
Do not use antidiarrheal drugs for more than two
days unless told to do so by a physician.
Severe, long-lasting diarrhea can lead to dehydra-
tion. In such cases, lost fluids and salts, such as calcium,
sodium, and potassium, must be replaced.
People older than 60 should not use attapulgite
(Kaopectate, Donnagel, Parepectolin), but may use other
kinds of antidiarrheal drugs. However, people in this age
group may be more likely to have side effects, such as
severe constipation, from bismuth subsalicylate. Ask the
pharmacist for more information.
Bismuth subsalicylate may cause the tongue or the
stool to temporarily darken. This is harmless. However,
do not confuse this harmless darkening of the stool with
the black, tarry stools that are a sign of bleeding in the
intestinal tract.
Children with flu or chicken pox should not be given
bismuth subsalicylate. It can lead to Reye’s syndrome,a
life-threatening condition that affects the liver and central
nervous system. To be safe, never give bismuth subsalicy-
late to a child under 16 years without consulting a physi-
cian. Children may have unpredictable reactions to other
antidiarrheal drugs. Loperamide should not be given to chil-
dren under six years and attapulgite should not be given to
children under three years unless directed by a physician.
Anyone who has a history of liver disease or who
has been taking antibioticsshould check with his or her
physician before taking the antidiarrheal drug lop-
eramide. A physician should also be consulted before
anyone with acute ulcerative colitisor anyone who has
been advised to avoid constipation uses the drug.
Loperamide should not be used by people whose
diarrhea is caused by certain infections, such as salmo-
nella or shigella. To be safe, check with a physician
before using this drug.
Anyone who has a medical condition that causes
weakness should check with a physician about the best
way to treat diarrhea.
Special conditions
Before taking antidiarrheal drugs, be sure to let the
physician know about any of these conditions: ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to aspirinor other drugs containing salicylates should
check with a physician before taking bismuth subsalicy-
late. Anyone who has developed a rash or other unusual
reactions after taking loperamide should not take that
drug again without checking with a physician. The physi-
cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING. Women who are
pregnant or breastfeeding should check with their physi-
cians before using antidiarrheal drugs. They should also
ask advice on how to replace lost fluids and salts.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using
antidiarrheal drugs, people with any of these medical
problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:
• dysentery
• gout
• hemophilia or other bleeding problems
• kidney disease
• stomach ulcer
• severe colitis
• liver disease
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking antidiarrheal
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects of attapulgite are con-
stipation, bloating, and fullness. Bismuth subsalicylate
may cause ringing in the ears, but that side effect is rare.
Possible side effects from loperamide include skin rash,
constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, dry mouth,
nausea, vomiting, and swelling,pain, and discomfort in
the abdomen. Some of these symptoms are the same as
those that occur with diarrhea, so it may be difficult to tell
if the medicine is causing the problems. Children may be
more sensitive than adults to certain side effects of lop-
eramide, such as drowsiness and dizziness.
Other rare side effects may occur with any antidiar-
rheal medicine. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after
taking an antidiarrhea drug should get in touch with his
or her physician.
Interactions
Attapulgite can decrease the effectiveness of other
medicines taken at the same time. Changing the times at
which the other medicines are taken may be necessary.

Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken with
aspirin or any other medicine that contains salicylate.
This drug may also interact with other drugs, such as
blood thinners (warfarin, for example), methotrexate, the
antigout medicine probenecid, and the antidiabetes drug
tolbutamide. In addition, bismuth subsalicylate may
interact with any drug that interacts with aspirin. Anyone
taking these drugs should check with a physician or phar-

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
test
Definition
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test, also called the
Vasopressin test, is a test for the antidiuretic hormone,
which is released from the pituitary gland and acts on the
kidneys to increase their reabsorption of water into the
blood.
Purpose
An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of dia-
betes insipidusor the syndrome of inappropriate ADH
called SIADH.
Precautions
Certain drugs can either increase or decrease ADH
levels. Drugs that increase ADH levels include aceta-
KEY TERMS
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon (large bowel).
Dehydration—Excessive loss of water from the
body.
Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,
that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.
Nutrient—A food substance that provides energy
or is necessary for growth and repair. Examples of
nutrients are vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins.
minophen,barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estrogen,
nicotine, oral hypoglycemiaagents, some diuretics
(e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tri-
cyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levels
include alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine antag-
onists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).
Description
The purpose of ADH is to control the amount of
water reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continually
being taken into the body in food and drink, as well as
being produced by chemical reactions in cells. Water is
also continually lost in urine, sweat, feces, and in the
breath as water vapor. ADH release helps maintain the
optimum amount of water in the body when there is an
increase in the concentration of the blood serum or a
decrease in blood volume. Physical stress, surgery, and
high levels of anxietycan also stimulate ADH.
Various factors can affect ADH production, thereby
disturbing the body’s water balance. For example, alcohol
consumption reduces ADH production by direct action on
the brain, resulting in a temporarily increased production
of urine. This may also occur in diabetes insipidus, when
the pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely,
when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse
effect of water retention can result from temporarily
increased ADH production after a major operation or
accident. Water retention may also be caused by the
secretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of the lung.
Preparation
The test requires collection of a blood sample. The
patient must be fasting(nothing to eat or drink) for 12
hours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical activity
for 10-12 hours before the test.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
ADH normal ranges are laboratory-specific but can
range from 1-5 pg/ml or 1.5 ng/L (SI units).
Abnormal results
Patients who are dehydrated, who have a decreased
amount of blood in the body (hypovolemia), or who are
undergoing severe physical stress (e.g., trauma,painor

ADH levels. Patients who are overly hydrated or who
have an increased amount of blood in the body (hyperv-
olemia) may have decreased ADH levels.
Other conditions that cause increased levels include
SIADH, central nervous system tumors or infection, or
pneumonia.

Definition
Systemic antifungal drugs are medicines taken by

Purpose
Systemic antifungal drugs are used to treat infec-

KEY TERMS
Diabetes insipidus—A metabolic disorder in
which the pituitary gland produces inadequate
amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or the
kidneys are unable to respond to release of the
hormone. Primary symptoms are excessive urina-
tion and constant thirst.
Pituitary gland—The pituitary gland is sometimes
referred to as the “master gland.” As the most impor-
tant of the endocrine glands (glands which release
hormones directly into the bloodstream), it regulates
and controls not only the activities of other
endocrine glands but also many body processes.
fungus. A fungus is an organism that can be either one-
celled or filamentous. Unlike a plant, which makes its
own food, or an animal, which eats plants or other ani-
mals, a fungus survives by invading and living off other
living things. Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, includ-
ing some parts of the body.
Fungal infections can either be systemic, meaning
that the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic),
meaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on the
skin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the mucous
membranes of the body. Fungal infections on the skin are
usually treated with creams or ointments (topical antifun-
gal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infections
or topical infections that do not clear up after treatment
with creams or ointments may need to be treated with sys-
temic antifungal drugs. These drugs are used, for example,
to treat common fungal infections such as tinea (ring-
worm), which occurs on the skin or candidiasis(a yeast
infection, also known as trush), which can occur in the
throat, in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They are
also used to treat other deep fungal infections such as
histoplasmosis,blastomycosis, and aspergillosis, which
can affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimes
used to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whose
immune systems are weakened, such as bone marrow or
organ transplant patients and people with AIDS.
Description
Antifungal drugs are categorized depending on their
route or site of action, their mechanism of action and
their chemical nature.
Systemic antifungal drugs, such as capsofungin (Can-
cidas), flucytosine, fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole
(Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and miconazole
(Monistat I.V.) are available only by prescription. They are
available in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal infec-
tion being treated. Doses may also be different for differ-
ent patients. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist
can provide dosage information. Systemic antifungal
drugs must be taken exactly as directed. Itraconazole and
ketoconazole should be taken with food.
Fungal infections can take a long time to clear up, so
it may be necessary to take the medication for several
months, or even for a year or longer. It is very important
to keep taking the medicine for as long as the physician
says to take it, even if symptoms seem to improve. If the
drug is stopped too soon, the symptoms may return.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	267
Antifungal drugs, systemic
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 267  Systemic antifungal drugs work best when their
amount is kept constant in the body, meaning that they
have to be taken regularly, at the same time every day,
and without missing any doses.
Patients taking the liquid form of ketoconazole
should use a specially marked medicine spoon or other
medicine measuring device to make sure they take the
correct amount. A regular household teaspoon may not
hold the right amount of medicine. Ask the pharmacists
about ways to accurately measure the dose of these drugs.
Precautions
If symptoms do not improve within a few weeks, the
prescribing physician should be informed.
While taking this medicine, regular medical visits
should be scheduled. The physician needs to keep check-
ing for side effects throughout the antifungal therapy.
Some people feel drowsy or dizzy while taking sys-
temic antifungal drugs. Anyone who takes these drugs
should not drive, use machines or do anything else that
might be dangerous until they have found out how the
drugs affect them.
Liver problems, stomach problems and other prob-
lems may occur in people who drink alcohol while taking
systemic antifungal drugs. Alcohol and prescription or
nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs that contain
alcohol should be avoided while taking antifungal drugs.
(Medicines that may contain alcohol include some cough
syrups, tonics, and elixirs.) Alcohol should be avoided
for at least a day after taking an antifungal drug.
The antifungal drug ketoconazole may make the
eyes unusually sensitive to light. Wearing sunglasses and
avoiding exposure to bright light may help.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take systemic antifungal drugs. Before taking these
drugs, the prescribing physician should be informed
about any of the following conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to
systemic antifungal drugs in the past should let his or her
physician know about the problem before taking the drugs
again. The physician should also be told about any aller-
giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.In laboratory studies of animals, sys-
temic antifungal drugs have caused birth defectsand
other problems in the mother and fetus. Studies have not
been done on pregnant women, so it is not known
whether these drugs cause similar effects in people.
Women who are pregnant or who plan to become preg-
nant should check with their physicians before taking
systemic antifungal drugs. Any woman who becomes
pregnant while taking these drugs should let her physi-
cian know immediately.
BREASTFEEDING.Systemic antifungal drugs pass
into breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should
check with their physicians before using systemic anti-
fungal drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. People who have
medical conditions that deplete stomach acid (achlorhy-
dria) or decrease stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) should be
sure to inform their physicians about their condition before
they use a systemic antifungal drug. These drugs are not
active in their natural form, but must be converted to the
active form by an acid. If these is not enough stomach acid,
the drugs will be ineffective. For people with insufficient
stomach acid, it may help to take the medicine with an
acidic drink, such as a cola. The patient’s health care
provider can suggest the best way to take the medicine.
Before using systemic antifungal drugs, people with
any of these medical problems should also make sure
their physicians are aware of their conditions:
• current or past alcohol abuse
• liver disease
• kidney disease
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking systemic anti-
fungal drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way
the drugs work or may increase the chance of side
effects.
Side effects
Fluconazole
Although rare, severe allergic reactions to this medi-
cine have been reported. Call a physician immediately if
any of these symptoms develop after taking fluconazole
(Diflucan):
• hives,itching, or swelling
• breathing or swallowing problems
• sudden drop in blood pressure
•diarrhea
• abdominal pain
Ketoconazole
Ketoconazole has caused anaphylaxis(a life-threat-
ening allergic reaction) in some people after their first
dose. This is a rare reaction.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 268  Systemic antifungal drugs in general
Systemic antifungal drugs may cause serious and
possibly life-threatening liver damage. Patients who take
these drugs should have liver function testsbefore they
start taking the medicine and as often as their physician
recommends while they are taking it. The physician
should be notified immediately if any of these symptoms
develop:
• loss of appetite
• nausea or vomiting
• yellow skin or eyes
• unusual fatigue
• dark urine
• pale stools
The most common minor side effects of systemic
antifungal drugs are constipation, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting,headache, drowsiness,dizziness, and flushing
of the face or skin. These problems usually go away as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment. Less common side effects, such as menstrual
problems in women, breast enlargement in men, and
decreased sexual ability in men also may occur and do
not need medical attention unless they do not improve in
a reasonable amount of time.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with the physician who prescribed the medicine immedi-
ately:
• fever and chills
• skin rash or itching
• high blood pressure
• pain, redness, or swelling at site of injection (for inject-
able miconazole)
Other rare side effects are possible. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking systemic antifungal drugs
should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Serious and possibly life-threatening side effects can
result if the oral forms of itraconazole or ketoconazole or
the injectable form of miconazole are taken with certain
drugs. Do not take those types of systemic antifungal
drugs with any of the following drugs unless the physi-
cian approves of the therapy:
• astemizole (Hismanal)
• cisapride (Propulsid)
• antacids
• theophylline-containing anti-wheezing medications
Taking an acid blocker such as cimetidine (Taga-
met), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), omeprazole
(Prilosec), or ranitidine (Zantac) at the same time as a
systemic antifungal drug may prevent the antifungal drug
from working properly. For best results, take the acid
blocker at least 2 hours after taking the antifungal drug.
In addition, systemic antifungal drugs may interact
with many other medicines. When this happens, the
effects of one or both of the drugs may change or the risk
of side effects may be greater. Anyone who takes sys-
temic antifungal drugs should inform the prescribing
physician about all other prescription and nonprescrip-
tion (over-the-counter) medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with systemic anti-
fungal drugs are:
• acetaminophen (Tylenol)
• birth control pills
• male hormones (androgens)
• female hormones (estrogens)

Antifungal drugs, topical
Definition
Topical antifungal drugs are medicines applied to
the skin to treat skin infections caused by a fungus.
Purpose
Dermatologic fungal infections are usually
described by their location on the body: tinea pedis
(infection of the foot), tinea unguium (infection of the
nails), tinia capitis (infection of the scalp.) Three types of
fungus are involved in most skin infections:Trichophy-
ton, Epidermophyton,and Microsporum.Mild infections
KEY TERMS
Elixir—A sweetened liquid that contains alcohol,
water, and medicine.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Fungus—A unicellular to filamentous organism
that causes parasitic infections.
Ointment—A thick substance that contains medi-
cine and is meant to be spread on the skin, or if an
ophthalmic ointment, in the eye.
Systemic—A term used to describe a medicine
that has effects throughout the body, as opposed to
topical drugs that work on the skin. Most medi-
cines that are taken by mouth or by injection are
systemic drugs.
are usually susceptible to topical therapy, however severe
or resistant infections may require systemic treatment.Description
There are a large number of drugs currently avail-
able in topical form for fungal infections. Other than the
imidazoles, (miconazole [Micatin, Miconazole], clotri-
mazole [Lotrimin], econazole [Spectazole], ketoconazole
[Nizoral], oxiconazole [Oxistat], sulconazole [Exel-
derm]) and the allylamine derivatives (butenafine [Men-
tax], naftifine [Naftin], terbinafine [Lamisil]), the drugs
in this therapeutic class are chemically distinct from each
other. All drugs when applied topically have a good mar-
gin of safety, and most show a high degree of effective-
ness. There are no studies comparing drugs on which to
base a recommendation for drugs of choice. Although
some of the topical antifungals are available over-the-
counter, they may be as effective as prescription drugs
for this purpose.
Traditional antifungal drugs such as undecylinic
acid (Cruex, Desenex) and gentian violet (also known as
crystal violet) remain available, but have a lower cure
rate (complete eradication of fungus) than the newer
agents and are not recommended. Tolnaftate (Tinactin)
has a lower cure rate than the newer drugs, but may be
used prophylactically to prevent infection.
Recommended dosage
All drugs are applied topically. Consult individual
product information for specific application recommen-
dations.
As with all topical products, selection of the dosage
form may be as important as proper drug selection. Con-
sider factors such as presence or absence of hair on the
affected area, and type of skin to which the medication is
to be applied. Thin liquids may preferable for application
to hairy areas, creams for the hands and face, and oint-
ments may be preferable for the trunk and legs. Other
dosage forms available include shampoos and sprays.
Ciclopirox and triacetin are available in formulations for
topical treatment of nail fungus as well as skin infections
(ciclopirox as Penlac Nail Lacquer and triacetin as Ony-
Clear Nail).
Most topical antifungal drugs require four weeks of
treatment. Infections in some areas, particularly the
spaces between toes, may take up to six weeks for cure.
Precautions
Most topical antifungal agents are well tolerated.
The most common adverse effects are localized irritation
caused by the vehicle or its components. This may
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2270
Antifungal drugs, topical
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 270  include redness, itch, and a burning sensation. Some
direct allergic reactions are possible.
Topical antifungal drugs should only be applied in
accordance with labeled uses. They are not intended or
ophthalmic (eye) or otic (ear) use. Application to mucous
membranes should be limited to appropriate formulations.
The antifungal drugs have not been evaluated for
safety in pregnancyand lactationon topical application
under the pregnancy risk category system. Although sys-
temic absorption is probably low, review specific refer-
ences. Gentian violet is labeled with a warning against
use in pregnancy.
Interactions
Topical antifungal drugs have no recognized drug-
drug or food-drug interactions.

Antigas agents
Definition
Antigas agents are medicines that relieve the uncom-
fortable symptoms of too much gas in the stomach and
intestines.
Purpose
Excess gas can build up in the stomach and
intestines for a number of reasons. Eating high-fiber
KEY TERMS
Cream—A spreadable substance, similar to an
ointment, but not as thick. Creams may be more
appropriate than ointments for application to
exposed skin areas such as the face and hands.
Ointment—A thick, spreadable substance that
contains medicine and is meant to be used on the
skin, or if a vaginal preparation, in the vagina.
Opthalmic—Pertaining to the eye.
Otic—Pertaining to the ear.
Topical—A term used to describe medicine that
has effects only in a specific area, not throughout
the body, particularly medicine that is put directly
on the skin.
foods, such as beans, grains, and vegetables is one
cause. Some people unconsciously swallow air when
they eat, drink, chew gum, or smoke cigarettes, which
can lead to uncomfortable amounts of gas in the diges-
tive system. Surgery and certain medical conditions,
such as irritable colon, peptic ulcer, and diverticulosis,
can also lead to gas build-up. Certain intestinal parasites
can contribute to the production of severe gas - these
parasites need to be treated separately with special
drugs. Abdominal pain, pressure, bloating, and flatu-
lence are signs of too much gas. Antigas agents help
relieve the symptoms by preventing the formation of gas
pockets and breaking up gas that already is trapped in
the stomach and intestines.
Description
Antigas agents are sold as capsules, liquids, and
tablets (regular and chewable) and can be bought without
a physician’s prescription. Some commonly used brands
are Gas-X, Flatulex, Mylanta Gas Relief, Di-Gel, and
Phazyme. The ingredient that helps relieve excess gas is
simethicone. Simethicone does not relieve acid indiges-
tion, but some products also contain antacidsfor that
purpose. Check the label of the product or ask the phar-
macist for more information.
Recommended dosage
Check the product container for dosing informa-
tion. Typically, the doses should be taken after meals
and at bedtime. Chewable forms should be chewed
thoroughly.
Check with a physician before giving this medicine
to children under age 12 years.
Precautions
Some anti-gas medicines may contain sugar, sodi-
um, or other ingredients. Anyone who is on a special diet
or is allergic to any foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances should check with his or her physician or
pharmacist before using any of these products.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to sime-
thicone—the active ingredient in antigas medicines—
should check with his or her physician before taking
these drugs.
Side effects
No common or serious side effects have been report-
ed in people who use this medicine. However, anyone
who has unusual symptoms after taking an antigas agent
should get in touch with his or her physician.

Antigastroesophageal reflux
drugs
Definition
These drugs are used to treat gastroesophageal
reflux, the backward flow of stomach contents into the
esophagus.
Purpose
The drug discussed here, cisapride (Propulsid), is
used to treat nighttime heartburnresulting from gas-
troesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this condition,
food and stomach juices flow backward from the stom-
ach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive tract
through which food passes on its way from the mouth to
the stomach. Normally, a muscular ring called the lower
esophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food into the
stomach and then closes to prevent the stomach’s con-
tents from flowing back into the esophagus. In people
with GERD, this muscular ring is either weak or it relax-
es at the wrong times. The main symptom is heartburn—
a burning sensation centered behind the breastbone and
spreading upward toward the neck and throat.
Cisapride works by strengthening the lower
esophageal sphincter and making the stomach empty
more quickly. This shortens the amount of time that the
esophagus comes in contact with the stomach contents.
KEY TERMS
Digestive tract—The stomach, intestines, and
other parts of the body through which food passes.
Diverticulosis—A condition in which the colon
(large intestine) develops a number of outpouch-
ings or sacs.
Flatulence—Excess gas in the digestive tract.
Irritable colon—An intestinal disorder often
accompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Other drugs, such as H2-blockers are sometimes pre-
scribed to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.Description
Cisapride is available only with a physician’s pre-
scription. Cisapride is sold in tablet and liquid forms.
Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the patient. The average dose
for adults and children age 12 and over is 5-20 mg taken
two to four times a day. The medicine should be taken 15
minutes before meals and at bedtime. For children under
12, the dose is based on body weight and should be
determined by the child’s physician.
Precautions
This medicine is effective in treating only nighttime
heartburn, not daytime heartburn.
Cisapride may increase the effects of alcohol and
tranquilizers.
Cisapride has caused dangerous irregular heartbeats
in a few people who took it with other medicines. Any-
one who takes this drug should let the physician know all
other medicines he or she is taking. Patients with heart
problems should check with their physicians before tak-
ing cisapride.
Anyone who has bleeding, blockage, or leakage in
the stomach or intestines should not take cisapride. Cis-
apride should not be used by anyone who has had an
unusual reaction to the drug in the past. In addition, peo-
ple with any of the following medical problems should
make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:
• epilepsy or history of seizures
• kidney disease
• liver disease
The effects of taking cisapride during pregnancy
have not been fully studied. Women who are pregnant or
plan to become pregnant should check with their physi-
cians before taking Cisapride. The drug passes into
breast milk and may affect nursing babies. Women who
are breastfeeding and need to take this medicine should
check with their physicians. Avoiding breastfeeding
while taking the drug may be necessary.
Side effects
The most common side effects are abdominal pain,
bloating, gas,diarrhea,constipation, nausea, upper res-
piratory infections, inflammation of the nasal passages

Antigastroesophageal reflux drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 272  and sinuses,headache, and viral infections. Other side
effects may occur. Anyone who has unusual or trouble-
some symptoms after taking this drug should get in touch
with his or her physician.
Interactions
Cisapride may interact with a variety of other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes Cisapride should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with cisapride are:
• antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole (Nizoral),
miconazole (Monistat), and fluconazole (Diflucan)
• antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and ery-
thromycin (E-Mycin, ERYC)
• blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin)
• H2-blockers such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and raniti-
dine (Zantac)
• tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diaz-
epam (Valium), and alprazolam (Xanax)
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with cisapride. Be sure to check with a physician or
pharmacist before combining cisapride with any other pre-
scription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.

Antihelminthic drugs
Definition
Antihelminthic drugs are used to treat parasitic
infestations.
Purpose
Parasitic infestations are caused by protozoa or
worms gaining entry into the body. Most of these organ-
isms cause infections by being ingested in the form of
eggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated food or
clothing, while others gain entry through skin abrasions.
Common parasitic infestations include amebiasis,malar-
ia,giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm, threadworm, whip-
worm and tapeworm infestations. Once in the body, para-
sitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severe
symptoms. However, if they multiply rapidly and spread to
a major organ, they can cause very serious and even life-
threatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are pre-
scribed to treat these infestations. They function either by
destroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them, or
by altering the permeability of their plasma membranes.
The dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces.
Description
Antihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre-
scription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules.
Some commonly used antihelminthics include: albenda-
zole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide
(Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel (Biltri-
cide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate (Antiminth)
and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types of parasitic
infestations are rarely seen in the United States, thus, the
corresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely dis-
tributed and need to be obtained from the United States
Center for Disease Control (CDC) when required. These
include for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treat
onchocerciasis infestations. Other antihelminthic drugs,
such as diethylcarbamazepine citrate (Hetrezan), used
for treatment of roundworms and other parasites, is sup-
plied directly by its manufacturer when needed.
Most antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe-
cific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, the
parasites must therefore be identified using tests that look
for parasites, eggs or larvae in feces, urine, blood, sputum,
or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is used against tapeworms,
but will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm or
roundworm infestations, because it acts by inhibiting ATP
production in tapeworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole)
is the drug usually prescribed for treatment of thread-
worm, but a similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works

being injured as a result.
Parasitic—Of, or relating to a parasite.
Pinworm—Enterobius vermicularis, a nematode
worm of the family Oxyuridae that causes parasitic
infestation of the intestines and cecum. Pinworm is
endemic in both temperate and tropical regions and
common especially in school age children.
Onchocerciasis—Parasitic infestation caused by fil-
amentous worms of the genus Onchocerca, espe-
cially O. volvulus, that is found in tropical America
and is transmitted by several types of blackflies.
Protozoan—Any unicellular or multicellular organ-

treated. The number of doses per day, the time between
doses, and the length of treatment will also depend on
these factors.
Antihelminthic drugs must be taken exactly as
directed to completely rid the body of the parasitic infes-
tation, and for as long as directed. A second round of
treatment may be required to ensure that the infection has
completely cleared.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2274
Antihelminthic drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 274  Precautions
Some antihelminthic drugs work best when ingested
along with fatty foods, such as milk or ice cream. Oral
drugs should be taken with water during or after meals.
The prescribing physician should be informed if the
patient has a low-fat or other special diet.
Some antihelminthic drugs, such as praziquantel,
come in chewable form. These tablets should not be
chewed or kept in the mouth, but should swallowed whole
because their bitter taste may cause gagging or vomiting.
Antihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be taken
with other medications. For example, steroids such as
prednisone are also prescribed together with the anti-
helminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflamma-
tion that the worm may cause.
When required, pre- or post-treatment purges are
also performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate.
Regular medical visits are recommended for people
affected by parasitic infestations. The physician monitors
whether the infection is clearing or not and also keeps
track of unwanted side effects. The prescribing physician
should be informed if symptoms do not disappear or if
they get worse.
Hookworm or whipworm infections are also treated
with iron supplements along with the antihelminthic pre-
scription.
Some types of parasitic infestations (e.g. pinworms)
can be passed from one person to another. It is then often
recommended that everyone in the household of an
infected person be asked to also take the prescribed anti-
helminthic drug.
Risks
People with the following medical conditions may
have adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs. The pre-
scribing physician should accordingly be informed if any
of these conditions are present:
•Allergies. Anyone who has had adverse reactions to
antihelminthic drugs should inform the prescribing
physician before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be informed about any other pre-existing
allergies.
• Ulcers. Antihelminthic drugs are also contraindicated
for persons diagnosed with ulcers of the digestive tract,
especially ulcerative colitis.
•Pregnancy. There is research evidence reporting that
some antihelminthic drugs cause birth defectsor mis-
carriagein animal studies. No human birth defects have
been reported, but antihelminthic drugs are usually not
recommended for use during pregnancy. Pregnant women
should accordingly inform the prescribing physician.
• Breastfeeding. Some antihelminthic drugs can pass into
breast milk. Breastfeeding may have to be discontinued
until the antihelminthic treatment has ended and breast-
feeding mothers must also inform the prescribing
physician.
• Other risk conditions. Any of the following medical
conditions should also be reported to the prescribing
physician:Crohn’s disease, liver disease, kidney dis-
ease and worm cysts in the eyes.
Common side effects of antihelminthic drugs include
dizziness, drowsiness,headache, sweating, dryness of the
mouth and eyes, and ringing in the ears. Anyone taking
these drugs should accordingly avoid driving, operating
machines or other activities that may be dangerous until
they know how they are affected by the drugs. Side effects
usually wear off as the body adjusts to the drug and do not
usually require medical treatment. Thiabendazole may
cause the urine to have an unusual odor that can last for a
day after the last dose. Other side effects of antihelminthic
drugs, such as loss of appetite,diarrhea, nausea, vomit-
ing, or abdominal cramps are less common. If they occur,
they are usually mild and do not require medical attention.
More serious side effects, such as fever, chills, con-
fusion, extreme weakness,hallucinations, severe diar-
rhea, nausea or vomiting, skin rashes,low back pain,
dark urine, blurred vision, seizures, and jaundicehave
been reported in some cases. The patient’s physician
should be informed immediately if any should develop.
As a rule, anyone who has unusual symptoms after start-
ing treatment with antihelminthic drugs should notify the
prescribing physician.
Antihelminthic drugs may interact with each other
or with other drugs, whether prescribed or not. For exam-
ple, it has been reported that use of the antihelminthic
drugs pyrantel and piperazine together lowers the effi-
ciency of pyrantel. Similarly, combining a given anti-
helminthic drug with another medication may increase
the risk of side effects from either drug.

Antihemorrhoid drugs
Definition
Antihemorrhoid drugs are medicines that reduce the
swelling and relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids
(swellings in the area around the anus).

Antihemorrhoid drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 275  Purpose
Hemorrhoids are bulges in the veins that supply
blood to the skin and membranes of the area around the
anus. They may form for various reasons. Frequent heavy
lifting, sitting for long periods, or straining to have bowel
movements may put stresson anal tissues, which can lead
to hemorrhoids. Some women develop hemorrhoids dur-
ing pregnancyas the expanding uterus puts pressure on
the anal tissues. The strain of labor and delivery can also
cause hemorrhoids or make existing hemorrhoids worse.
Hemorrhoids sometimes result from certain medical
problems, such as tumors pressing on the lower bowel.
The main symptoms of hemorrhoids are bleeding
from the rectum, especially after a bowel movement, and
itching, burning,pain, and general discomfort in the
anal area. Over-the-counter antihemorrhoid products can
relieve many of these symptoms. The products contain
combinations of four main types of ingredients:
• local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine and
tetracaine, to temporarily relieve the pain
• vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine base, epinephrine
hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate and phenylephrine
hydrochloride that reduce swelling and relieve itching
and discomfort by tightening blood vessels
• astringents (drying agents), such as witch hazel,
calamine, and zinc oxide. These help shrink hemor-
rhoids by pulling water out of the swollen tissue. This,
in turn, helps relieve itching, burning, and irritation.
• protectants, such as cocoa butter, lanolin, glycerin, min-
eral oil, and shark liver oil which soothe irritated tissues
and form a protective barrier to prevent further irrita-
tion
Description
Antihemorrhoid drugs are available as creams, oint-
ments and suppositories. Most can be bought without a
physician’s prescription.
Recommended dosage
Follow package instructions for using these prod-
ucts. Do not use more than the recommended amount of
this medicine every day. For explanations or further
information about how to use antihemorrhoid drugs,
check with a physician or pharmacist.
Precautions
Do not use antihemorrhoid drugs for more than
seven days in a row. If the problem gets worse or does
not improve, check with a physician.
KEY TERMS
Anus—The opening at the end of the intestine
through which solid waste (stool) passes as it
leaves the body.
Rectum—The end of the intestine closest to the
anus.
Uterus—A hollow organ in a female in which a
fetus develops until birth.
If rectal bleeding continues, check with a physician.
This could be a sign of a condition that needs medical
attention.
Side effects
Side effects are rare, however, if a rash or any other
sign of an allergic reaction occurs, stop using the medicine.
Interactions
Some antihemorrhoid drugs should not be used by
people who are taking or have recently taken monoamine
oxidase inhibitors(MAO inhibitors), such as phenelzine
(Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate), used to treat condi-
tions including depression and Parkinson’s disease.
Anyone who is not sure if he or she has taken this type of
drug should check with a physician or pharmacist before
using an antihemorrhoid drug. People who are taking
antidepressants or medicine for high blood pressure also
should not use certain antihemorrhoid drugs. Check with
a pharmacist for a list of drugs that may interact with spe-
cific antihemorrhoid drugs.

Antihistamines
Definition
Antihistamines are drugs that block the action of
histamine (a compound released in allergic inflammatory
reactions) at the H
1receptor sites, responsible for imme-
diate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing and
itching. Members of this class of drugs may also be used
for their side effects, including sedationand antiemesis
(prevention of nausea and vomiting).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2276
Antihistamines
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 276  Purpose
Antihistamines provide their primary action by
blocking histamine H
1at the receptor site. They have no
effect on rate of histamine release, nor do they inactivate
histamine. By inhibiting the activity of histamine, they
can reduce capillary fragility, which produces the erythe-
ma, or redness, associated with allergic reactions. They
will also reduce histamine-induced secretions, including
excessive tears and salivation. Additional effects vary
with the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs,
called first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selec-
tively to H
1receptors in the central nervous system as
well as to peripheral receptors, and can produce sedation,
inhibition of nausea and vomiting, and reduction of
motion sickness. The second-generation antihistamines
bind only to peripheral H
1receptors, and reduce allergic
response with little or no sedation.
The first-generation antihistamines may be divided
into several chemical classes. The side effect profile,
which also determines the uses of the drugs, will vary by
chemical class. The alkylamines include brompheni-
ramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trime-
ton.) These agents cause relatively little sedation, and are
used primarily for treatment of allergic reactions. Promet-
hazine (Phenergan), in contrast, is a phenothiazine, chem-
ically related to the major tranquilizers, and while it is
used for treatment of allergies, may also be used as a
sedative, the relieve anxietyprior to surgery, as an anti-
nauseant, and for control of motion sickness. Diphenhy-
dramine (Benadryl) is chemically an ethanolamine, and in
DANIELE BOVET (1907–1992)
A gifted researcher in therapeutic chemistry,
Daniele Bovet was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, one
of four children of a professor of experimental educa-
tion. Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomy
at the University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of sci-
ence degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Insti-
tute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory of
Therapeutic Chemistry in 1936.
Bovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller-
gy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, so
Bovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub—
began studying substances that blocked hormones simi-
lar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first anti-
histamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substance
was too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performed
thousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihista-
mines. This work formed the basis for the development
of subsequent clinically useful antihistamines.
addition to its role in reducing allergic reactions, may be
used as a nighttime sedative, for control of drug-induced
Parkinsonism, and, in liquid form, for control of coughs.
Consult more detailed references for further information.
The second generation antihistamines have no cen-
tral action, and are used only for treatment of allergic
reactions. These are divided into two chemical classes.
Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a piperazine derivative, and has a
slight sedative effect. Loratidine (Claritin) and fexofena-
dine (Allegra) are members of the piperadine class and
are essentially non-sedating.
Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, patient and intended use.
Consult more detailed references for further information.
When used for control of allergic reactions, antihista-
mines should be taken on a regular schedule, rather than on
an as-needed basis, since they have no effect on histamine
itself, nor on histamine already bound to the receptor site.
Efficacy is highly variable from patient to patient. If
an antihistamine fails to provide adequate relief, switch
to a drug from a different chemical class. Individual
drugs may be effective in no more than 40% of patients,
and provide 50% relief of allergic symptoms.

mine), loratadine (Claritin) are all listed as category B.
Azelastine (Astelin), hydroxyzine (Atarax), promethazine
(Phenergan) are category C.
Regardless of chemical class of the drug, it is recom-
mended that mothers not breast feed while taking antihis-
tamines.
Contraindications
The following are absolute or relative contraindica-
tions to use of antihistamines. The significance of the
contraindication will vary with the drug and dose.
• glaucoma
• hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
• high blood pressure
• enlarged prostate
• heart disease
• ulcers or other stomach problems
• stomach or intestinal blockage
• liver disease
• kidney disease
• bladder obstruction
• diabetes
Interactions
Drug interactions will vary with the chemical class
of antihistamine. In general, antihistamines will increase
the effects of other sedatives, including alcohol.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants (phe-
nelzine [Nardil], tranylcypromine [Parnate]) may prolong
and increase the effects of some antihistamines. When
used with promethazine (Phenergan) this may cause
reduced blood pressure and involuntary movements.

Antihypertensive drugs
Definition
Antihypertensive drugs are medicines that help
lower blood pressure.
Purpose
The overall class of antihypertensive agents lowers
blood pressure, although the mechanisms of action vary
greatly. Within this therapeutic class, there are several
subgroups. There are a very large number of drugs used to
control hypertension, and the drugs listed below are rep-
resentatives, but not the only members of their classes.
The calcium channel blocking agents, also called
slow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit the
movement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane.
This reduces the force of contraction of muscles of the
heart and arteries. Although the calcium channel block-
ersare treated as a group, there are four different chemi-
cal classes, leading to significant variations in the activi-
ty of individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) has
the greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil
(Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greater
effect on the heart muscle itself.
Peripheral vasodilatorssuch as hydralazine
(Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil
(Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels.
There are several groups of drugs which act by reduc-
ing adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory nerve
stimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in the
arteries, veins, and heart. These drugs include the beta-
adrenergic blockers and alpha/beta adrenergic blockers.
There are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents.
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol
(Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol (Visken).
Propranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic receptors any-
where in the body, and has been used as a treatment for
emotional anxietyand rapid heart beat. Atenolol and
acebutolol (Sectral) act specifically on the nerves of the
heart and circulation.
There are two alpha/beta adrenergic blockers,
labetolol (Normodyne, Trandate) and carvedilol (Coreg).
These work similarly to the beta blockers.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACE
inhibitors) act by inhibiting the production of angiotensin
II, a substance that both induces constriction of blood
vessels and retention of sodium, which leads to water
retention and increased blood volume. There are 10 ACE
inhibitors currently marketed in the United States,
including captopril (Capoten), benazepril (Lotensin),
enalapril (Vasotec), and quinapril (Acupril). The primary
difference between these drugs is their onset and dura-
tion of action.
The ACE II inhibitors, losartan (Cozaar), candesar-
tan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan
(Micardis), valsartan (Diovan) and eprosartan (Teveten)
directly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blocking
its production. Their actions are similar to the ACE
inhibitors, but they appear to have a more favorable side
effect and safety profile.
In addition to these drugs, other classes of drugs
have been used to lower blood pressure, most notably the
thiazide diuretics. There are 12 thiazide diuretics mar-
keted in the United States, including hydrochlorothiazide
(Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide
(Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). The
drugs in this class appear to lower blood pressure
through several mechanisms. By promoting sodium loss
they lower blood volume. At the same time, the pressure
of the walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascular
resistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonly
used as the first choice for reduction of mild hyperten-
sion, and may be used in combination with other antihy-
pertensive drugs.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage varies with patient, drug,
severity of hypertension, and whether the drug is being
used alone or in combination with other drugs. Consult
specialized references for further information.
Precautions
Because of the large number of classes and individ-
ual drugs in this group, consult specialized references for
complete information.
Peripheral vasodilators may cause dizzinessand

sure when the patient stands up in the morning. Patients

slowly. Pregnancyrisk factors for this group are gener-
ally category C. Hydralazine has been shown to cause
cleft palate in animal studies, but there is no human data
available. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but
may rarely cause dangerous reactions including laryn-
gospasm and angioedema. Persistent coughis a com-
mon side effect. ACE inhibitors should not be used in
pregnancy. When used in pregnancy during the second
and third trimesters, angiotension-converting inhibitors
(ACEIs) can cause injury to and even deathin the devel-
oping fetus. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue
the ACE inhibitor as soon as possible. Breastfeeding is
not recommended.
ACE II inhibitors are generally well tolerated and do
not cause cough. Pregnancy risk factor is category C dur-
ing the first trimester and category D during the second
and third trimesters. Drugs that act directly on the renin-
angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidi-
ty and death when administered to pregnant women. Sev-
eral dozen cases have been reported in patients who were
taking ACE inhibitors. When pregnancy is detected, dis-
continue AIIRAs as soon as possible. Breast feeding is
not recommended.
Thiazide diuretics commonly cause potassium deple-
tion. Patients should have potassium supplementation
either through diet, or potassium supplements. Pregnancy
risk factor is category B (chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone,

Anti-hyperuricemic drugs
Definition
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs are used to treat hyper-
uricemia, the state of having too much uric acid in the
blood.
Purpose
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs decrease the levels of uric
acid in the blood, either by increasing the rate at which
uric acid is excreted in the urine, or by preventing the
formation of excess uric acid.
Precautions
Before taking any medication, patients should notify
their physician of all other medications that they are cur-
rently taking. Patients should also notify their physician
of any health problems they are currently experiencing.
Patients must notify physicians if they have kidney prob-
lems, since this might affect the type of drug adminis-
tered. Patients must also notify their physician if they are
allergic to any of the medications used to treat acute or
long-term gout. Since all of these factors contribute to
the disease, patients suffering from gout should attempt
to lose weight, avoid excess alcohol consumption, and
avoid foods high in purines, such as asparagus, sardines,
lobster, avocado, and peas.
Description
Gout and hyperuricemia
Persons with high levels of uric acid (hyper-
uricemia) may experience gout. Commonly gout occurs
in males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by the
attacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is often
accompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints. The
most common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney
stones, and/or poor kidney function may also be associ-
ated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered gout
if the patient does not have painful joints. In persons with
gout (and associated symptoms), uric acid forms crystals,
which then cause the aforementioned symptoms.
Although uric acid levels must be high in order for
patients to have crystals form, and therefore have gout,
most persons with high uric acid levels don’t ever have
symptoms. Thus, recent criteria for use of anti-hyper-
uricemic agents suggest that patients who have never
experienced symptoms of gout should not receive drug
therapy, unless their hyperuricemia is associated with
cancer(may lead to kidney damage) or certain rare

Sydney, Australia, 2000).
Acute gout attacks
When patients experience acute attacks of gout, drugs
that lower the levels of uric acid can cause an acute gout
attack or cause an attack to become more severe. Thus,
drugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat gout
in the long term are not used in the short term. Medica-
tions used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin), colchicine,
and corticosteroids. Colchicine causes side effects in a
large number of individuals (usually diarhhea). The most
important factor in the effective treatment of gout may not
be the drug used, but how quickly it is administered after
an acute attack has begun.
Long-term treatment
Long-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia usu-
ally involves one of four drugs: allopurinol, probenicid,
sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone (as of this printing
in 2001, benzbromarone is not available for use in the
United States). While allopurinol decreases the amount
of uric acid that is produced (and may help prevent acute
attacks of gout), the other drugs all increase the rate at
which uric acid is excreted in the urine. As previously
mentioned, lowering the concentration of uric acid can
cause gout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medica-
tions should have the dose slowly increased (and uric
acid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute attacks of
gout. Patients may also be treated with colchicine or non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent acute
attacks of gout (corticosteroids are not used in this sce-
nario because over the long term corticosteroids have
deleterious side effects).

Anti-insomnia drugs
Definition
Anti-insomnia drugs are medicines that help people
fall asleep or stay asleep.
Purpose
Physicians prescribe anti-insomnia drugs for short-
term treatment of insomnia—a sleep problem in which
people have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or
wake up too early and can’t go back to sleep. These drugs	should be used only for occasional treatment of tempo-	rary sleep problems and should not be taken for more than	a week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems last	longer than this should see a physician. Their sleep prob-	lems could be a sign of another medical problem.
Description
The anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem
(Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system
(CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines that
slow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe medi-
cines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam
(Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), esta-
zolam (ProSom), and temazepam (Restoril), for insom-
nia. Benzodiazepine drugs are described in the essay on
antianxiety drugs. Zaleplon (Sonata) is another anti-
insomnia drug that is not related to other drugs with the
same effect. The barbiturates, such as pentobarbital
(Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longer
commonly used to treat insomnia because they are too
dangerous if they are taken in overdoses. For patients
with mild insomnia, some antihistamines, such as
diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax)
may be used, since these also cause sleepiness.
Zolpidem is available only with a physician’s pre-
scription and comes in tablet form.

The recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just
before bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often within
20 minutes, so it should be taken right before going to bed.
For older people and others who may be more sensi-
tive to the drug’s effects, the recommended starting
dosage is 5 mg just before bedtime.
Never take more than 10 mg of zolpidem in one 24-
hour period. Overdoses can lead to excessive sleepiness
or coma.
Zolpidem may be taken with food or on an empty
stomach, but it may work faster when taken on an empty
stomach. Check with a physician or pharmacists for
instructions on how to take the medicine.
Precautions
Zolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment of
insomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to 10
days, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep prob-
lems could be a sign of another medical problem. Also,
this drug may lose its effectiveness when taken every
night for more than a few weeks.

Anti-insomnia drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 282  Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, light-
headed, or less alert the morning after they have taken
zolpidem. The medicine may also cause clumsiness,
unsteadiness, double vision, or other vision problems the
next day. For these reasons, anyone who takes these
drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else
that might be dangerous until they have found out how
zolpidem affects them.
This medicine has caused cause behavior changes in
some people, similar to those seen in people whose
behavior changes when they drink alcohol. Examples
include giddiness and rage. More extreme changes, such
as confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, also are pos-
sible. Anyone who starts having strange or unusual
thoughts or behavior while taking this medicine should
get in touch with his or her physician.
Zolpidem and other sleep medicines may cause a
special type of temporary memory loss, in which the per-
son does not remember what happens between the time
they take the medicine and the time its effects wear off.
This is usually not a problem, because people go to sleep
right after taking the medicine and stay asleep until its
effects wear off. But it could be a problem for anyone
who has to wake up before getting a full night’s sleep
(seven to eight hours). In particular, travelers should not
take this medicine on airplane flights of less than seven
to eight hours.
Because zolpidem works work on the central ner-
vous system, it may add to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system,
such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,
medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some painrelievers,
and muscle relaxants. Zolpidem may also add to the
effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental
procedures. The combined effects of zolpidem and alco-
hol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central
nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to
unconsciousness or even death. People who take zolpi-
dem should not drink alcohol and should check with their
physicians before taking any other CNS depressant. Any-
one who shows signs of an overdose or of the effects of
combining zolpidem drugs with alcohol or other drugs
should have immediate emergency help. Warning signs
include severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting,
breathing problems, and staggering.
Anyone who takes zolpidem for more than one to
two weeks should not stop taking it without first check-
ing with a physician. Stopping the drug abruptly may
cause rebound insomnia; increased difficulty falling
asleep for the first one of two nights after the drug has
been discontinued. In rare cases, withdrawal symptoms,
such as vomiting, cramps, and unpleasant feelings may
occur. Gradual tapering may be necessary.
Older people may be more sensitive to the effects of
zolpidem. This may increase the chance of side effects,
such as confusion, and may also increase the risk of
falling.
In people with breathing problems, zolpidem may
worsen the symptoms.
Special conditions
People with certain other medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take zolpidem. Before taking this medicine, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to zolpidem in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes,
preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with their physicians
about the safety of using zolpidem during pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING.Women who are breastfeeding
should check with their physicians before using zolpi-
dem.

Anti-itch drugs
Definition
Anti-itch drugs are medicines taken by mouth or by
injection to relieve itching.
Purpose
The medicine described here, hydroxyzine, is a type
of antihistamine used to relieve itching caused by allergic
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2284
Anti-itch drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 284  reactions. An allergic reaction occurs when the body is
unusually sensitive to some substance, such as pollen,
dust, mold, or certain foods or medicine. The body reacts
by releasing a chemical called histamine that causes itch-
ing and other symptoms, such as sneezing and watery
eyes. Antihistaminesreduce the symptoms by blocking
the effects of histamine.
Hydroxyzine is also prescribed for anxietyand to help
people relax before or after having general anesthesia.
Description
Anti-itch drugs, also called antipruritic drugs, are
available only with a physician’s prescription and come in
tablet and injectable forms. Some commonly used brands
of the anti-itch drug hydroxyzine are Atarax and Vistaril.
Recommended dosage
When prescribed for itching, the usual dosage for
adults is 25 mg, three to four times a day. For children
over six years of age, the usual dosage 50-100 mg per
day, divided into several small doses. The usual dosage
for children under six years of age is 50 mg per day,
divided into several small doses.
The dosage may be different for different people.
Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the
pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct
dosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed.
Precautions
This medicine should not be used for more than four
months at a time because its effects can wear off. See a
physician regularly while taking the medicine to deter-
mine whether it is still needed.
Hydroxyzine may add to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system,
such as other antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medi-
cine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some
painrelievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking
hydroxyzine should not drink alcohol and should check
with his or her physician before taking any of the above.
Some people feel drowsy or less alert when using
this medicine. Anyone who takes it should not drive, use
machines, or do anything else that might be dangerous
until they have found out how the drugs affect them.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to hydrox-
yzine in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the medicine again. The physician should
also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preserva-
tives, or other substances.
KEY TERMS
Anesthesia—Treatment with medicine that causes
a loss of feeling, especially pain. Local anesthesia
numbs only part of the body; general anesthesia
causes loss of consciousness.
Antihistamine—Medicine that prevents or relieves
allergy symptoms.
A woman who is pregnant or who may become
pregnant should check with her physician before taking
this medicine. In studies of laboratory animals, hydrox-
yzine has caused birth defectswhen taken during preg-
nancy. Although the drug’s effects on pregnant women
have not been fully studied, physicians advise against
taking it in early pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING.Women who are breastfeeding
should also check with their physicians before using
hydroxyzine. The medicine may pass into breast milk
and may cause problems in nursing babies whose moth-
ers take it.
Side effects
The most common side effect, drowsiness, usually
goes away as the body adjusts to the drug. If it does not,
reducing the dosage may be necessary. Other side
effects, such as dry mouth, also may occur and do not
need medical attention unless they continue.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with the physician who prescribed the medicine as soon
as possible:
• twitches or tremors
• convulsions (seizures)
Interactions
Hydroxyzine may interact with other medicines.
When this happens, the effects of one or both of the
drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes hydroxyzine should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with hydroxyzine are:
• barbiturates such as phenobarbital and secobarbital
(Seconal)
• opioid (narcotic) pain medicines such as meperidine
(Demerol) and oxycodone (Percocet)

The list above may not include every drug that inter-
acts with hydroxyzine. Be sure to check with a physician
or pharmacist before combining hydroxyzine with any
other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter)
medicine.

Antimalarial drugs
Definition
Antimalarial drugs are medicines that prevent or
treat malaria.
Purpose
Antimalarial drugs treat or prevent malaria, a disease
that occurs in tropical, subtropical, and some temperate
regions of the world. The disease is caused by a parasite,
Plasmodium, which belongs to a group of one-celled
organisms known as protozoa. The only way to get
malaria is to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito that
has bitten someone who has the disease.Thanks to mos-
quito control programs, malaria has been eliminated in
the United States, almost all of Europe, and large parts of
Central and South America. However, mosquito control
has not worked well in other parts of the world, and
malaria continues to be a major health problem in parts
of Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, and some Pacific Islands. Every
year, some 30,000 Americans and Europeans who travel
to these areas get malaria. People planning to travel to
the tropics are often advised to take antimalarial drugs
before, during, and after their trips, to help them avoid
getting the disease and bringing it home with them.
These drugs kill Plasmodiumor prevent its growth.
In recent years, some strains of Plasmodiumhave
become resistant to antimalarial drugs, and medical
researchers have stepped up efforts to develop a malaria
vaccine. In early1997, researchers reported encouraging
results from a small study of one vaccine and planned to
test the vaccine in Africa.
Description
Antimalarial drugs are available only with a physi-
cian’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, and
injectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalari-
al drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine (Lariam),	primaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), and quinine.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of anti-
malarial drug, its strength, and the form in which it is
being used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage may
also be different for different people. Check with the
physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always take
this medicine exactly as directed, and keep taking it for
the full time of treatment. If the drug is being taken to
treat malaria, do not stop taking it just because symptoms
begin to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is
stopped too soon. Never take larger or more frequent
doses than the physician has ordered, and do not take the
drug for longer than directed.
Travelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria may
be told to take it for one to two weeks before their trip and
for 4 weeks afterward, as well as for the whole time they
are away. It is important to follow these directions.
Antimalarial drugs work best when they are taken on
a regular schedule. When taken once a week to prevent
malaria, they should be taken on the same day every
week. When taken daily or several times a day to treat
malaria, they should be taken at the same time every day.
Doses should not be missed or skipped.
Some antimalarial drugs should be taken with meals
or with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others must be
taken with a full glass of water. Be sure to follow direc-
tions for the best way to take the drug that is prescribed.
Precautions
Antimalarial drugs may cause lightheadedness,
dizziness, blurred vision and other vision changes. Any-
one who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines
or do anything else thatmight be dangerous until they
have found out how the drugs affect them.
The antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) has
received attention because of reports that it causes panic
attacks,hallucinations,anxiety, depression,paranoia,
and other mental and mood changes, sometimes lasting
for months after the last dose. A study published in 1996
in the British Medical Journalnoted that about one in 140
travelers who take the drug may have mental or mood
changes severe enough to interfere with normal activities.
This compares to about one in 1,100 patients who have
such reactions to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Any-
one who has unexplained anxiety, depression, restless-
ness, confusion, or other troubling mental or mood
changes after taking mefloquine should call a physician
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2286
Antimalarial drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 286  right away. Switching to a different antimalarial drug may
be an alternative and can allow the side effects to stop.
Anyone taking antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria
who develops a feveror flu-like symptoms while taking
the medicine or within two to three months after travel-
ing to an area where malaria is common should call a
physician immediately.
If the medicine is being taken to treat malaria, and
symptoms stay the same or get worse, check with the
physician who prescribed the medicine.
Patients who take this medicine over a long time
need to have a physician check them periodically for
unwanted side effects.
Babies and children are especially sensitive to the
antimalarial drug chloroquine. Not only are they more
likely to have side effects from the medicine, but they are
also at greater risk of being harmed by an overdose. A
single 300-mg tablet could kill a small child. Keep this
medicine out of the reach of children. Use safety vials.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take antimalarial drugs. Before taking these drugs,
be sure to let the physician know about any of these
conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reac-
tions to antimalarial drugs or related medicines in the
past should let his or her physician know before taking
the drugs again. The physician should also be told
about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or
other substances.
PREGNANCY.In laboratory animal studies, some
antimalarial drugs cause birth defects. But it is also
risky for a pregnant woman to get malaria. Untreated
malaria can cause premature birth,stillbirth, and mis-
carriage. When given in low doses to prevent malaria,
antimalarial drugs have not been reported to cause birth
defects in humans. If possible, pregnant women should
avoid traveling to areas where they could get malaria. If
travel is necessary, women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with their physicians
about the use of antimalarial drugs.
BREASTFEEDING.Some antimalarial drugs pass into
breast milk. Although no problems have been reported in
nursing babies whose mothers took antimalarial drugs,
babies and young children are particularly sensitive to
some of these drugs. Women who are breastfeeding
should check with their physicians before using anti-
malarial drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-
malarial drugs, people who have any of these medical
problems (or have had them in the past) should make
sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:
• blood disease
• liver disease
• nerve or brain disease or disorder, including seizures
(convulsions)
• past or current mental disorder
• stomach or intestinal disease
• deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (G6PD), which is important in the break-
down of sugar in the body
• deficiency of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide (NADH) methemoglobin reductase
• psoriasis
• heart disease
• family or personal history of the genetic condition fav-
ism (a hereditary allergic condition)
• family or personal history of hemolytic anemia, a con-
dition in which red blood cells are destroyed
• purpura
• hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
• blackwater fever (a serious complication of one type of
malaria)
• myasthenia gravis (a disease of the nerves and muscles)
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antimalarial
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
High doses of the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine
may cause blood problems that caninterfere with healing
and increase the risk of infection. People taking this drug
should be careful not to injure their gums when brushing
or flossing their teeth or using toothpicks. If possible,
dental work should be postponed until treatment is com-
plete and the blood has returned to normal.
The most common side effects of antimalarial drugs
are diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, stomach cramps or
pain, loss of appetite,headache,itching, difficulty con-
centrating, dizziness, lightheadedness, and sleep prob-
lems. These problems usually go away as the body
adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treatment.
Less common side effects, such as hair loss or loss of
color in the hair; skin rash; or blue-black discoloration of
the skin, fingernails, or inside of the mouth also may

Antimalarial drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 287  occur and do not need medical attention unless they are
long-lasting.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check with
the physician who prescribed the medicine immediately:
• blurred vision or any other vision changes
• convulsions (seizures)
• mood or mental changes
• hallucinations
• anxiety
• confusion
• weakness or unusual tiredness
• unusual bruising or bleeding
• hearing loss or ringing or buzzing in the ears
• fever, with or without sore throat
• slow heartbeat
• pain in the back or legs
• dark urine
• pale skin
• taste changes
• soreness, swelling, or burning sensation in the tongue
Other rare side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking anantimalarial drug
should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Some antimalarial drugs may interact with other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Anyone who takes antimalarial drugs should
let the physician know all other medicines he or she is
taking. Among the drugs that interact with some anti-
malarial drugs are:
• beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), propranolol
(Inderal), and metoprolol (Lopressor)
• calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem (Cardizem),
nicardipene (Cardene), and nifedipine (Procardia)
• other antimalarial drugs
• quinidine, used to treat abnormal heart rhythms
• antiseizure medicines such as vaproic acid derivatives
(Depakote or Depakene)
• oral typhoid vaccine
• diabetes medicines taken by mouth
• sulfonamides (sulfa drugs)
• vitamin K

Antimigraine drugs
Definition
Antimigraine drugs are medicines used to prevent or
reduce the severity of migraine headaches.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2288
Antimigraine drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 288  Purpose
Migraine headaches usually cause a throbbing pain
on one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting,dizziness,
increased sensitivity to light and sound, and other symp-
toms may accompany the pain. The attacks may last for
several hours or for a day or more and may come as often
as several times a week. Some people who get migraine
headaches have warning signals before the headaches
begin, such as restlessness, tingling in an arm or leg, or
seeing patterns of flashing lights. This set of signals is
called an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in this
section are meant to be taken as soon as the pain begins,
to relieve the pain and other symptoms. Other types of
drugs, such as antiseizure medicines, antidepressants,
calcium channel blockersand beta blockers, are some-
times prescribed to prevent attacks in people with very
severe or frequent migraines.
Description
Migraine is thought to be caused by electrical and
chemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain. These
imbalances affect the blood vessels in the brain—first
tightening them up, then widening them. As the blood ves-
sels widen, they stimulate the release of chemicals that
increase sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation and
swelling. Antimigraine drugs are believed to work by cor-
recting the imbalances and by tightening the blood vessels.
Examples of drugs in this group are ergotamine
(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex),
rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methy-
sergide maleate (Sansert) may be used by patients whose
headaches are not controlled by other drugs, while some
patients do well on other drugs. For example, combina-
tions or ergotamine and caffeinemay be very effective.
The caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to relieve
the headache. Sometimes, an analgesic such as aceta-
minophen, caffeine, and a barbiturate which acts as a
sedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and similar com-
pounds. These medicines are available only with a physi-
cian’s prescription and come in several forms. Ergota-
mine is available as tablets and rectal suppositories;
sumatriptan as tablets, injections, and nasal spray; and
zolmitriptan as tablets.
Antimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches once
they have started. These drugs should not be taken to pre-
vent headaches.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of drug.
Typical recommended dosages for adults are given below
for each type of drug.
Ergotamine
Take at the first sign of a migraine attack. Patients
who get warning signals (aura) may take the drug as soon
as they know a headache is coming.
TABLETS.No more than six tablets for any single
attack.
No more than 10 tablets per week.
SUPPOSITORIES.No more than two suppositories
for any single attack.
No more than five suppositories per week.
Naratriptan
Take as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms
begin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.
Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as not
all auras result in a migraine.
TABLETS.Usual dose is one 1-mg tablet taken with
water or other liquid.
Doses of 2.5-mg may be used, but they may cause
more side effects.
If the headache returns or if there is only partial
response, the dose may be repeated once after four hours,
for a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period. Larger
doses do not seem to offer any benefit.
Sumatriptan
Take as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms
begin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.
Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as not
all auras result in a migraine.
TABLETS.Usual dose is one 25-mg tablet, taken with
water or other liquid.
Doses should be spaced at least two hours apart.
Anyone with liver disease should consult with a
physician for proper dosing.
INJECTIONS.No more than 6 mg per dose, injected
under the skin.
No more than two 6-mg injections per day. These
doses should be taken at least 1 hour apart.
Zolmitriptan
Take as soon as symptoms begin.
TABLETS.Usual dose is 1-5 mg. Additional doses
may be taken at two-hour intervals.
No more than 10 mg per 24-hour period.

Antimigraine drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 289  General dosage advice
Always take antimigraine drugs exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take
the drug for longer than directed.
If possible, lie down and relax in a dark, quiet room
for a few hours after taking the medicine.
Precautions
These drugs should be used only to treat the type of
headache for which they were prescribed. Patients should
not use them for other headaches, such as those caused
by stressor too much alcohol, unless directed to do so by
a physician.
Anyone whose headache is unlike any previous
headache should check with a physician before taking these
drugs. If the headache is far worse than any other, emer-
gency medical treatment should be sought immediately.
Taking too much of the antimigraine drug ergota-
mine (Cafergot), can lead to ergot poisoning. Symptoms
include headache, muscle pain, numbness, coldness, and
unusually pale fingers and toes. If not treated, the condi-
tion can lead to gangrene(tissue death).
Sumatriptan (Imitrex), naratriptan (Amerge), riza-
triptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) may interact
with ergotamine. These drugs should not be taken within
24 hours of taking any drug containing ergotamine.
Some antimigraine drugs work by tightening blood
vessels in the brain. Because these drugs also affect
blood vessels in other parts of the body, people with
coronary heart disease, circulatory problems, or high
blood pressure should not take these medicines unless
directed to do so by their physicians.
Special conditions
People with certain other medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take antimigraine drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to ergotamine, caffeine, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, or
other antimigraine drugs in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking the drugs again. The physi-
cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Women who are pregnant should not
take ergotamine (Cafergot). The effects of other antimi-
graine drugs during pregnancyhave not been well stud-
ied. Any woman who is pregnant or plans to become
pregnant should let her physician know before an antimi-
graine drug is prescribed.
BREASTFEEDING.Some antimigraine drugs can pass
into breast milk and may cause serious problems in nurs-
ing babies. Women who are breastfeeding should check
with their physicians about whether to stop breastfeeding
while taking the medicine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using
antimigraine drugs, people with any of these medical
problems should make sure their physicians know about
their conditions:
• coronary heart disease
• angina (crushing chest pain)
• circulatory problems or blood vessel disease
• high blood pressure
• liver problems
• kidney problems
• any infection
• eye problems
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking antimigraine
drugs certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are fluid retention,
flushing; high blood pressure; unusually fast or slow
heart rate; numbness; tingling; itching; nausea; vomit-
ing; weakness; neck or jaw pain and stiffness; feelings of
tightness, heaviness, warmth, or coldness; sore throat;
and discomfort of the mouth and tongue.

Nancy Ross-FlaniganAntimyocardial antibody test
Definition
Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done when
evaluating a person for heart damage or heart disease.
Purpose
Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies. Nor-
mal antibodies are special proteins built by the body as a
defense against foreign material entering the body.
Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body, but
instead of attacking foreign material, they inappropriate-
ly attack the body’s own cells. Antimyocardial antibodies
attack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium.
This test may be done on a person who recently had
trauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a myocardial
infarction (heart attack). It also may be done on some-
one with heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy or
rheumatic fever.
Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodies
does not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is a
connection between the presence of these antibodies and
damage to the heart. The amount of damage, however,
cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	291
Antimyocardial antibody test
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 291  These antibodies usually appear after heart surgery
or the beginning of disease, but they may be present
before surgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of people
with myocardial infarction and 70% of people having
heart surgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear with-
in two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks.
Description
A 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from the
patient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow. Antimyocar-
dial antibodies are detected by combining a patient’s
serum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood) with cells from
animal heart tissue, usually that of a monkey. Antimyocar-
dial antibodies in the serum bind to the heart tissue cells. A
fluorescent dye is then added to the mixture. This dye will
attach to any antibodies and heart tissue cells bound
together. The final mixture is studied under a microscope
that is designed to show fluorescence. If fluorescent cells
are seen under the microscope, the test is positive.
When the test is positive, the next step is to find out
how much antibody is present. The patient’s serum is
diluted, or titered, and the test is done again. The serum is
then further diluted and the test repeated until the serum is
so dilute that fluorescence is no longer seen. The last dilu-
tion that showed fluorescence is the titer reported.
Preparation
No fastingor special prepartion is needed. Before
the test is done it should be explained to the patient.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site after the blood is drawn or the person may feel dizzy
or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding
stops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the puncture site
relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen in
healthy individuals.
Abnormal results
A positive result means that antimyocardial antibod-
ies are present and that heart disease or damage is likely.
Further testing may be needed as other autoantibodies
could also be present, causing a false abnormal test.

Antinausea drugs
Definition
Antinausea drugs are medicines that control nausea—
a feeling of sickness or queasiness in the stomach with an
urge to vomit. These drugs also prevent or stop vomiting.
Drugs that control vomiting are called antiemetic drugs.
Purpose
The drug described here, prochlorperazine (Com-
pazine), controls both nausea and vomiting. Prochlor-
perazine is also sometimes prescribed for symptoms of
mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.
Description
Prochlorperazine is available only with a physician’s
prescription. It is sold in syrup, capsule, tablet, injection,
and suppository forms.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2292
Antinausea drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 292  Recommended dosage
To control nausea and vomiting in adults, the usual
dose is:
• tablets: one 5-mg or 10-mg tablet three to four times a
day
• extended-release capsules: one 15-mg capsule first
thing in the morning or one 10-mg capsule every 12
hours
• suppository: 25 mg, twice a day
• syrup: 5-10 mg three to four times a day
• injection: 5-10 mg injected into a muscle three to four
times a day
Doses for children must be determined by a physician.
Precautions
Prochlorperazine may cause a movement disorder
called tardive dyskinesia. Signs of this disorder are
involuntary twitches and muscle spasms in the face and
body and jutting or rolling movements of the tongue. The
condition may be permanent. Older people, especially
women, are particularly at risk of developing this prob-
lem when they take prochlorperazine.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or
less alert when using this medicine. The drug may also
cause blurred vision, and movement problems. For
these reasons, anyone who takes this drug should not
drive, use machines or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the drug
affects them.
Prochlorperazine makes some people sweat less,
which can allow the body to overheat. The drug may
also make the skin and eyes more sensitive to the sun.
People who are taking prochlorperazine should try to
avoid extreme heat and exposure to the sun. When
going outdoors, they should wear protective clothing, a
hat, a sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of
at least 15, and sunglasses that block ultraviolet (UV)
light. Saunas, sunlamps, tanning booths, tanning beds,
hot baths, and hot tubs should be avoided while taking
this medicine. Anyone who must be exposed to extreme
heat while taking the drug should check with his or her
physician.
This medicine adds to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system,
such as antihistamines, cold and flu medicines, tran-
quilizers, sleep aids, anesthetics, some painmedicines,
and muscle relaxants. Do not drink alcohol while tak-
ing prochlorperazine, and check with the physician who
prescribed the drug before combining it with any other
medicines.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it. Stopping the drug
suddenly can dizziness, nausea, vomiting,tremors, and
other side effects. When stopping the medicine, it may be
necessary to taper down the dose gradually.
Prochlorperazine may cause false pregnancytests.
Women who are pregnant (or planning to become
pregnant) or breast feeding should check with their
physicians before using this medicine.
Before using prochlorperazine, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-
cians are aware of their conditions:
• previous sensitivity or allergic reaction to prochlorper-
azine
• heart disease
• glaucoma
• brain tumor
• intestinal blockage
• abnormal blood conditions, such as leukemia
• exposure to pesticides.
Side effects
Many side effects are possible with this drug,
including, but not limited to,constipation, dizziness,
drowsiness, decreased sweating,dry mouth, stuffy nose,
movement problems, changes in menstrual period,
increased sensitivity to sun, and swelling or pain in
breasts. Anyone who has unusual or troublesome symp-
toms after taking prochlorperazine should get in touch
with his or her physician.

Antinuclear antibody test
Definition
The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test done
early in the evaluation of a person for autoimmune or
rheumatic disease, particularly systemic lupus erythe-
matosus(SLE).
Purpose
In autoimmune diseases, the body makes antibodies
that work against its own cells or tissues. Rheumatic dis-
eases (diseases that affect connective tissue, including
the joints, bone, and muscle) are also associated with
KEY TERMS
Anesthetic—Medicine that causes a loss of feel-
ing, especially pain. Some anesthetics also cause a
loss of consciousness.
Antihistamine—Medicine that prevents or relieves
allergy symptoms.
Central nervous system—The brain, spinal cord
and the nerves throughout the body.
Spasm—Sudden, involuntary tensing of a muscle
or a group of muscles.

and is used to treat anxiety and mental tension.
these antibodies. Autoantibodies are proteins built by the
body, but instead of guarding against foreign material
(including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as normal anti-
bodies do, they attack the body’s own cells.
Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult
to diagnose. People with the same disease can have very
different symptoms. A helpful strategy in the diagnosis
of these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibody
in the person’s blood.
The antinuclear antibody test looks for a group of
autoantibodies that attack substances found in the center
(nucleus) of all cells. It is useful as a screen for many
autoantibodies associated with diseases that affect the
entire body (systemic diseases).
This test is particularly useful when diagnosing a
person with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects
many body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it is
unlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,
more tests are done to confirm whether the person has
SLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as
scleroderma,Sjögren’s syndrome,Raynaud’s disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis, often
have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.
Description
Five to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The
antinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s
serum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope
slide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they bind
to the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second anti-
body is added to the mixture. This antibody is “tagged”
with a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen. The second
antibody attaches to any antibodies and cells bound
together and, because of the fluorescent “tag,” the areas
with antinuclear antibodies seem to glow, or fluoresce,
when the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope.
If fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.
When positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and the
test done again. These steps are repeated until the serum
is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last
dilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported.
The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives the
physician clues as to what the disease might be. The test
result includes the titer and the pattern.
This test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear
antibody test or FANA. Results are available within one
to three days.
Preparation
No special preparations or diet changes are required
before a person undergoes an antinuclear antibody test.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2294

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 294  Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the
puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.
Warm packs relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results will be negative, showing no antinu-
clear antibodies.
Abnormal results
A positive test in a person with symptoms of an
autoimmune or rheumatic disease helps the physician
make a diagnosis. More than 95% of people with SLE
have a positive ANA test. Scleroderma has a 60-71%
positive rate; Sjögren’s disease, 50-60%, and rheumatoid
arthritis, 25-30%.
Several factors must be considered when interpret-
ing a positive test. Diseases other than autoimmune dis-
eases can cause autoantibodies. Some healthy people
have a positive test. More testing is done after a positive
test to identify individual autoantibodies associated with
the various diseases.

Antiparkinson drugs
Definition
Antiparkinson drugs are medicines that relieve the
symptoms of Parkinson’s diseaseand other forms of
parkinsonism.
Purpose
Antiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms of
parkinsonism, a group of disorders that share four main
symptoms: tremor or trembling in the hands, arms, legs,
jaw, and face; stiffness or rigidity of the arms, legs, and
trunk; slowness of movement (bradykinesia); and poor
balance and coordination. Parkinson’s disease is the most
common form of parkinsonism and is seen more fre-
quently with advancing age. Other forms of the disorder
may result from viral infections, environmental toxins,
carbon monoxide poisoning, and the effects of treat-
ment with antipsychotic drugs.
The immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease or
Parkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotrans-
mitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may take sev-
eral forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibition
of dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of the
dopamine already present, or sensitization of dopamine
receptors. Drugs may be used singly or in combination.
Description
Levodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of Parkinson’s
treatment. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is
converted to dopamine. The drug may be administered
alone, or in combination with carbidopa (Lodosyn) which
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	295
Antiparkinson drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 295  inhibits the enzyme responsible for the destruction of lev-
odopa. The limitation of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa
therapy is that after approximately two years of treatment,
the drugs cease to work reliably. This has been termed the
“on-off phenomenon.” Additional treatment strategies
have been developed to retard the progression of Parkin-
sonism, or to find alternative approaches to treatment.
Anticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms
of Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of dopamine,
thereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohor-
mone. They may be effective in all stages of the disease.
All drugs with anticholinergic properties, the naturally
occurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine,
hyoscyamine), some antihistamineswith anticholinergic
properties, and synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin),
procyclidine (Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) are
members of this group. Although the anticholinergic
drugs have only limited activity against Parkinson’s dis-
ease, they are useful in the early stages, and may be
adjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses.
Amantadine (Symmetrel), was developed for pre-
vention of influenzavirus infection, but has anti-Parkin-
sonian properties. Its mechanism of action is not known.
Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor,
which is used for a variety of indications including
amenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility, and
acromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation of
the dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a late
adjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction in
levodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar to
bromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively in
Parkinson’s disease.
Entacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaining
levels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is used
as an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning to
experience the on-off effect. Tolcapone (Tasmar) is a
similar agent, but has demonstrated the potential for
inducing severe liver failure. As such, tolcapone is
reserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapies
have failed or are contraindicated.
Selegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selective
monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however its
mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear, since
other drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed to show
similar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is used pri-
marily as an adjunct to levodopa, although some studies
have indicated that the drug may be useful in the early
stages of Parkinsonism, and may delay the progression
of the disease.
Pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip) are
believed to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine recep-
tors in the brain. They may be used alone in early Parkison’s
disease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages.
Recommended dosage
Dosages of anti-Parkinsonian medications must be
highly individualized. All doses must be carefully titrat-
ed. Consult specific references.
Precautions
There are a large number of drugs and drug classes
used to treat Parkinson’s disease, and individual refer-
ences should be consulted.
The anticholinergics have a large number of adverse
effects, all related to their primary mode of activity. Their
cardiovascular effects include tachycardia,palpitations,
hypotension, postural hypotension, and mild bradycar-
dia. They may also cause a wide range of central nervous
system effects, including disorientation, confusion,
memory loss,hallucinations, psychoses, agitation, ner-
vousness,delusions,delirium,paranoia, euphoria,
excitement, lightheadedness,dizziness,headache, list-
lessness, depression, drowsiness, weakness, and giddi-
ness. Dry mouth, dry eyes and gastrointestinal distress
are common problems. Sedationhas been reported with
some drugs in this group, but this may be beneficial in
patients who suffer from insomnia. Pregnancyrisk fac-
tor is C. Because anticholinergic drugs may inhibit milk
production, their use during breastfeeding is not recom-
mended. Patients should be warned that anticholinergic

Levodopa has a large number of adverse effects.
Anorexia, loss of appetite, occurs in roughly half the
patients using this drug. Symptoms of gastrointestinal
upset, such as nausea and vomiting, have been reported
in 80% of cases. Other reported effects include increased
hand tremor; headache; dizziness; numbness; weakness
and faintness; bruxism; confusion; insomnia; nightmares;
hallucinations and delusions; agitation and anxiety;
malaise; fatigueand euphoria. Levodopa has not been list-
ed under the pregnancy risk factor schedules, but should
be used with caution. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
Amantadine is generally well tolerated, but may cause
dizziness and nausea. It is classified as pregnancy schedule
C. Since amantadine is excreted in breast milk, breastfeed-
ing while taking amantidine is not recommended.
Pergolide and bromocriptine have been generally
well tolerated. Orthostatic hypotensionare common
problems, and patients must be instructed to risk slowly
from bed. This problem can be minimized by low initial
doses with small dose increments. Hallucinations may be
a problem. Bromocriptine has not been evaluated for
pregnancy risk, while pergolide is category B. Since both

are in pregnancy category C. In animals, ropinirole has
been shown to have adverse effects on embryo-fetal
development, including teratogenic effects, decreased
fetal body weight, increased fetal deathand digital mal-
formation. Because these drugs inhibit prolactin secre-
tion, they should not be taken while breastfeeding.
Side effects
The most common side effects are associated with
the central nervous system, and include dizziness, light-
headedness, mood changes and hallucinations. Gastroin-
testinal problems, including nausea and vomiting, are
also common.
Interactions
All anti-Parkinsonian regimens should be carefully

Antiprotozoal drugs
Definition
Antiprotozoal drugs are medicines that treat infec-
tions caused by protozoa.
Purpose
Antiprotozoal drugs are used to treat a variety of dis-
eases caused by protozoa. Protozoa are animal-like, one-
celled animals, such as amoebas. Some are parasites that
cause infections in the body. African sleeping sickness,
giardiasis,amebiasis,Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
(PCP), and malariaare examples of diseases caused by
protozoa.
Description
Antiprotozoal drugs come in liquid, tablet, and
injectable forms and are available only with a doctor’s
prescription. Some commonly used antiprotozoal drugs
are metronidazole (Flagyl), eflornithine (Ornidyl), fura-
zolidone (Furoxone), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil),
iodoquinol (Diquinol, Yodoquinol, Yodoxin), and pen-
tamidine (Pentam 300).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antiprotozoal drug, its strength, and the medical problem
for which it is being used. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-
scription for the correct dosage. Always take antiproto-
zoal drugs exactly as directed.
Precautions
Some people feel dizzy, confused, lightheaded, or
less alert when using these drugs. The drugs may also
cause blurred vision and other vision problems. For these
reasons, anyone who takes these drugs should not drive,
use machines or do anything else that might be danger-
ous until they have found out how the drugs affect them.
The antiprotozoal drug furazolidone may cause very
dangerous side effects when taken with certain foods or
beverages. Likewise, metronidazole (Flagyl) can cause
serious liver damage if taken with alcohol. Check with
the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist
who filled the prescription for a list of products to avoid
while taking these medicines.
Anyone who has ever had unusual reactions to
antiprotozoal drugs or related medicines should let his or
her physician know before taking the drugs again. The
physician should also be told about any allergiesto
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Some antiprotozoal drugs may cause problems with
the blood. This can increase the risk of infection or
excessive bleeding. Patients taking these drugs shouldbe
careful not to injure their gums when brushing or floss-
ing their teeth or using a toothpick. They shouldcheck
with the physician before having any dentalwork done.
Care should also be taken to avoidcuts from razors, nail
clippers, or kitchen knives, orhousehold tools. Anyone
who has any of these symptoms while taking antiproto-
zoal drugs should call the physician immediately:
• fever or chills
• signs of cold or flu
• signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or inflam-
mation
• unusual bruising or bleeding
• black, tarry stools
• blood in urine or stools
• pinpoint red spots on the skin
• unusual tiredness or weakness.
Anyone taking this medicine should also check with
a physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur:
• blurred vision or other vision changes
• skin rash,hives, or itching
• swelling of the neck
• clumsiness or unsteadiness
• numbness, tingling,pain, or weakness in the hands or
feet
• decrease in urination

antiprotozoal drugs. Never give this medicine to a child
unless directed to do so by a physician, and always keep
this medicine out of the reach of children. Use safety vials.
The effects of antiprotozoal drugs on pregnant
women have not been studied. However, in experiments
with pregnant laboratory animals, some antiprotozoal
drugs cause birth defectsor deathof the fetus. Women
who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant
should check with their physicians before taking
antiprotozoal drugs. Mothers who are breastfeeding
should also check with their physicians about the safety
of taking these drugs.
Before using antiprotozoal drugs, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-
cians are aware of their conditions:
• anemia or other blood problems
• kidney disease
• heart disease
• low blood pressure
• diabetes
• hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
• liver disease
• stomach or intestinal disease
• nerve or brain disease or disorder, including convul-
sions (seizures)
• psoriasis (a skin condition)
• hearing loss
• deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (G6PD)
• eye or vision problems
• thyroid disease
Side effects
The most common side effects are diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, and stomach pain. These problems usually go
away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not require
medical treatment.
Other rare side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking an antiprotozoal drug
should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Antiprotozoal drugs may interact with other medi-
cines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be

Antipsychotic drugs
Definition
Antipsychotic drugs are a class of medicines used to
treat psychosisand other mental and emotional condi-
tions.
Purpose
Psychosis is defined as “a serious mental disorder
(as schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lost
contact with reality often with hallucinationsor delu-
sions.” Psychosis is an end-stage condition arising from a
variety of possible causes. Anti-psychotic drugs control
the symptoms of psychosis, and in many cases are effec-
tive in controlling the symptoms of other disorders that
may lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder
(formerly termed manic-depressive), in which the patient
cycles from severe depression to feelings of extreme
excitation. This class of drugs is primarily composed of
the major tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, a
drug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, is
commonly classified among the antipsychotic agents.
Description
The antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi-
cal class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group, and
include chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine (Ser-
entil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine
(Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in action
and adverse effects. They may also be used as anti-emet-
ics, although prochlorperazine is the drug most often
used for this indication.
The phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol (Haldol)
and pimozide (Orap). They find primary use in control of
Tourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol has been extremely
useful in controlling aggressive behavior.
The debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril),
loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiap-
ine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psy-
chotic symptoms that have not been responsive to other
classes of drugs.
The benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone
(Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone has
been found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorder,
while ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treat-
ment for schizophrenia.
In addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychotic
agents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Lithonate),
which is used for control of bipolar mood disorder, and
thiothixene (Navane), which is used in the treatment of
psychosis.
Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the drug, condition being treated,
and patient response. See specific references.
Precautions
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a
rare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal symp-
toms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance.
Onset may be hours to months after drug initiation, but
once started, proceeds rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. It is
most commonly associated with haloperidol, long-acting
fluphenazine, but has occurred with thiothixene, thiori-
dazine, and clozapine, and may occur with other agents.
NMS is potentially fatal, and requires intensive sympto-
matic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neu-
roleptic treatment. There is no established treatment.
Most patients who develop NMS will have the same
problem if the drug is restarted.
Tardive dyskinesia(TD). Tardive dyskinesia is a
syndrome of involuntary movements that may appear in
patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Although preva-
lence of TD appears highest among the elderly, especial-
ly women, it is impossible to predict which patients are
likely to develop the syndrome. Both the risk of develop-
ing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible
are increased with higher doses and longer periods of
treatment. The syndrome can develop after short treat-
ment periods at low doses. Anticholinergic agents may
worsen these effects. Clozapine has occasionally been
useful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychot-
ic drugs.
Agranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine.
This is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be prevented
with careful monitoring of the white blood count. There
are no well-established risk factors for developing agran-
ulocytosis, and so all patients treated with this drug must
follow the clozapine Patient Management System. For
more information, call 1-800-448-5938.
Anticholinergic effects, particularly dry mouth,
have been reported with all of the phenothiazines, and
can be severe enough to cause patients to discontinue
their medication.
Photosensitization is a common reaction to chlor-
promazine. Patients must be instructed to use precautions
when exposed to sunlight.

quency of urination.
Antipsychotic drugs are pregnancycategory C.
(Clozapine is category B.) The drugs in this class appear
to be generally safe for occasional use at low doses dur-
ing pregnancy, but should be avoided near time of deliv-
ery. Although the drugs do not appear to be teratogenic,
when used near term, they may cross the placenta and
have adverse effects on the newborn infant, including
causing involuntary movements. There is no information
about safety in breast feeding.
As a class, the antipsychotic drugs have a large num-
ber of potential side effects, many of them serious. Spe-
cific references should be consulted.
Interactions
Because the phenothiazines have anticholinergic
effects, they should not be used in combination with
other drugs that may have similar effects.
Because the drugs in this group may cause hypoten-
sion, or low blood pressure, they should be used with
extreme care in combination with blood pressure-lower-
ing drugs.
The antipsychotic drugs have a large number of drug
interactions. Consult specific references.

Antipsychotic drugs, atypical
Definition
The atypical antipsychotic agents, sometimes called
the “novel” antipsychotic agents are a group of drugs
which are different chemically from the older drugs used
to treat psychosis. The “conventional”antipsychotic
drugsare classified by their chemical structures as the
phenothiazines, thioxanthines (which are chemically
very similar to the phenothiazines), butyrophenones,
diphenylbutylpiperadines and the indolones. All of the
atypical antipsychotic agents are chemically classified as
dibenzepines. They are considered atypicalor novel
because they have different side effects from the conven-
tional antipsychotic agents. The atypical drugs are far
less likely to cause extra-pyrammidal side-effects(EPS),
drug induced involuntary movements, than are the older
drugs. The atypical antipsychotic drugs may also be
effective in some cases that are resistant to older drugs.
The drugs in this group are clozapine (Clozaril),
loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiap-
ine (Seroquel).
Purpose
The antipsychotic drugs are used to treat severe
emotional disorders. Although there may be different
names for these disorders, depending on severity and
how long the symptoms last, psychotic disorders all
cause at least one of the following symptoms:
• delusions
•hallucinations
• disorganized speech
• grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
Loxapine has also been used to treat anxietywith
mental depression.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dose depends on the drug, the
patient, and the condition being treated. The normal
practice is to start each patient at a low dose, and gradu-
ally increase the dose until a satisfactory response is
achieved. The odse should be held at the lowest level that
gives satisfactory results.

600 milligrams a day, but some people require as much
as 900 milligrams/day. Doses higher than 900 mill-

Loxapine is usually effective at doses of 60-100 mil-
ligrams/day, but may be used in doses as high as 250
mg/day if needed.
Olanzapine doses vary with the condition being
treated. The usual maximum dose is 20 milligrams/day.
Quetiapine may be dosed anywhere from 150-750 mil-
ligrams/day, depending on how well the patient responds.
Precautions
Although the atypical antipsychotics are generally
safe, clozapine has been associated with severe agranulo-
cytosis, a shortage of white blood cells. For this reason,
people who may be treated with clozapine should have
blood counts before starting the drug, blood counts every
week for as long as they are using clozapine, and blood
counts every week for the first four weeks after they stop
taking clozapine. If there is any evidence of a drop in the
white blood countwhile using clozapine, the drug
should be stopped.
Atypical antipsychotics should not be used in
patients with liver damage, brain or circulatory prob-
lems, or some types of blood problems.
Allergies
People who have had an allergic reaction to one of
the atypical antipsychotics should not use that medica-
tion again. However, sometimes it is possible to use a
different drug from the same group safely.
Pregnancy
The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved
safe in pregnancy. They should be used only when
clearly needed and when potential benefits outweigh
potential hazards to the fetus. These drugs have not been
reported in human milk.
Side effects
Although the atypical antipsychotics are less likely to
cause involuntary movements than the older antipsychotic
drugs, they still have a large number of adverse effects.
The following list is not complete. Review each drug indi-
vidually for a full list of possible adverse effects.
• chest pain
• high blood pressure
• low blood pressure
• fast heart beat
KEY TERMS
Anxiety—An abnormal and overwhelming sense
of apprehension and fear often marked by physio-
logical signs (as sweating, tension, and increased
pulse), by doubt concerning the reality and nature
of the threat, and by self-doubt about one’s capac-
ity to cope with it.
Delusions—A false belief regarding the self or per-
sons or objects outside the self that persists despite
the facts.
Depression—A state of being depressed marked
especially by sadness, inactivity, difficulty with
thinking and concentration, a significant increase or
decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feel-
ings of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimes
suicidal thoughts or an attempt to commit suicide.
Glucocorticoid—Any of a group of corticosteroids
(as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone) that are
anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and
that are used widely in medicine (as in the allevia-
tion of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis).

ized by defective or lost contact with reality often
with hallucinations or delusions.
• aggitation
• memory loss
• confusion

Interactions
Taking atypical antipsychotic medications with cer-
tain other drugs may affect the way the drugs work or
may increase the chance of side effects. While taking
antipsychotic drugs, do not take any other prescription or

checking with a physician.
Because the atypical antipsychotics may cause low-
ering of blood pressure, care should be used when these
drugs are taken at the same time as other drugs which
lower blood pressure.
Quetiapine has many interactions. Doses should be
carefully adjusted when quetiapine is used with keto-
conazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, car-
bamazepine,barbiturates, rifampin or glucocorticoids
including prednisone, dexamethasone and methylpred-
nisolone.
These drugs will also require dose adjustments when
used with antiparkinson drugs.

Antiretroviral drugs
Definition
Antiretroviral drugs inhibit the reproduction of
retroviruses—viruses composed of RNA rather than
DNA. The best known of this group is HIV, human
immunodeficiencyvirus, the causative agent of AIDS.
Purpose
Antiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which
block steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs are
not curative; however continued use of drugs, particular-
ly in multi-drug regimens, significantly slows disease
progression.
Description
There are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,
although only two steps in the viral replications process
are blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reverse	transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine (ddI,	Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine (d4T, Zerit),	zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir),	act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase.	Because a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus must	make a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reverse	transcriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making the	DNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase	inhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is a	faulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing.
The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-
hibitors(NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor),
loviride, and nevirapine (Viramune) act by binding
directly to the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibiting
its activity.
Protease inhibitors, such as indinavir (Crixivan),
nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir
(Invirase) act on the enzyme protease, which is essential
for the virus to break down the proteins in infected cells.
Without this essential step, the virus produces immature
copies of itself, which are non-infectious.
Because HIV mutates readily, the virus can develop
resistance to single drug therapy. However, treatment
with drug combinations appears to produce a durable
response. Proper treatment appears to slow the progres-
sion of HIV infections and reduce the frequency of
opportunistic infections.
Recommended dosage
Doses must be individualized based on the patient,
and use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinations
of antiretroviral drugs have not been determined, nor is
there agreement on the stage of infection at which to start
treatment.
Precautions
Although the antiretroviral drugs fall into three
groups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effects
and drug interactions. Since the drugs are used in various
combinations, the frequency and severity of adverse
effects will vary with the combination. Although most
drug combinations show a higher rate of adverse events
that single drug therapy, some patterns are not pre-
dictable. For example, indinavir has been reported to
cause insomniain 3% of patients, however, when used
in combination with zidovudine, only 1.5% of patients
complained of sleep difficulties.
The most severe adverse effects associated with the
protease inhibitors are renal and hepatic toxicity. Patients
have also reported a syndrome of abdominal distention

Antiretroviral drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 303  and increased body odor, which may be socially limiting.
Hemophilic patients have reported increased bleeding
tendencies while taking protease inhibitors. The drugs
are pregnancycategory B. There have been no con-
trolled studies of safety in pregnancy. HIV-infected
mothers are advised not to breast feed in order to prevent
transmission of the virus to the newborn.
The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have
significant levels of toxicity. Lactic acidosis in the
absence of hypoxemia and severe hepatomegaly with
steatosis have been reported with zidovudine and zal-
citabine, and are potentially fatal. Rare cases of hepatic
failure, considered possibly related to underlying hepati-
tis Band zalcitabine monotherapy, have been reported.
Abacavir has been associated with fatal hypersensi-
tivity reactions. Didanosine has been associated with
severe pancreatitis. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors are pregnancy category C. There is limited
information regarding safety during pregnancy. Zidovu-
dine has been used during pregnancy to reduce the risk of
HIV infection to the infant. HIV-infected mothers are
advised not to breastfeed in order to prevent transmission
of the virus to the newborn.
Efavirenz has been associated with a high frequency
of skin rash, 27% in adults and 40% in children. Nevirap-
ine has been associated with severe liver damage and
skin reactions. All of the non-nucleoside reverse tran-
scriptase inhibitors are pregnancy category C, based on
animal studies.
KEY TERMS
Antiviral drugs—Medicines that cure or control
virus infections.
Bioavailability—A measure of the amount of drug
that is actually absorbed from a given dose.
Immune system—The body’s natural defenses
against disease and infection.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Insomnia—A sleep disorder characterized by
inability to either fall asleep or to stay asleep.
Mutates—Undergoes a spontaneous change in the
make-up of genes or chromosomes.
Pancreas—A gland located beneath the stomach.
The pancreas produces juices that help break down
food and secretes insulin that helps the body use
sugar for energy.
Pregnancy category—A system of classifying drugs
according to their established risks for use during
pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies
have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B: Animal
studies indicate no fetal risk, but no human studies;
or adverse effects in animals, but not in well-con-
trolled human studies. Category C: No adequate
human or animal studies; or adverse fetal effects in
animal studies, but no available human data. Cate-
gory D: Evidence of fetal risk, but benefits outweigh
risks. Category X: Evidence of fetal risk. Risks out-
weigh any benefits.
Retrovirus—A virus composed of ribonucleic acid
(RNA) instead of deoxynucleic acid (DNA).
Virus—A tiny, disease-causing particle that can
reproduce only in living cells.
Because of the high risk of viral resistance develop-
ment, antiretroviral agents should be used in combina-
tion. If one drug in the group must be discontinued, it is
recommended that all antiretroviral therapy be discontin-
ued until a multi-drug regimen can be resumed. The non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors particularly
should not be used alone.
Interactions
Because of the high frequency of drug interactions
associated with AIDS therapy, specialized references
should be consulted.
Saquinavir is marketed in both hard and soft gelatin
capsules. Because saquinavir in the hard gelatin capsule
formulation (Invirase) has poor bioavailability, it is rec-
ommended that this formulation only be used in combi-
nation with other drugs which interact to raise saquinavir
blood levels. Saquinavir soft gelatin capsules (Fortovase)
are the preferred dosage form of this drug.

Antirheumatic drugs
Definition
Antirheumatic drugs are drugs used to treat rheuma-
toid arthritis.
Purpose
Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive form of arthritis
that has devastating effects on joints and general health. It
is classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis-
ease is caused by the body’s own immune system acting
against the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff,
swollen joints,fever,fatigue, and loss of appetite.
In recent years, there has been a change in attitude
concerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi-
cians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs
(DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and are
less inclined to wait for crippling stages before resorting
to the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of the
side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types of
antirheumatic drugs.
Description
The major classes of antirheumatic drugs include:
• Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs.
Drugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic relief
of both inflammation and pain, but have a limited effect
on the progressive bone and cartilage loss associated
with rheumatoid arthritis. They act by slowing the
body’s production of prostaglandins. Common NSAIDs	include: ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin or Advil), naproxen	(Naprosyn, Aleve) and indomethacin(Indocin).
•Corticosteroids. These drugs are very powerful anti-
inflammatory agents. They are the synthetic analogs of
cortisone, produced by the body. Corticosteroids are
used to reduce inflammation and suppress activity of
the immune system. The most commonly prescribed
are prednisone and dexamethasone.
• Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).
DMARDs influence the disease process itself and do not
only treat symptoms, hence their name. DMARDs also
have anti-inflammatory effects, and most were borrowed
from the treatment of other diseases, such as cancerand
malaria. Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine
(Aralen) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Powerful
DMARDs include: methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sul-
fasalazine, cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran) and
cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine, sulfasalazine,
penicillamine, and organic gold compounds such as
aurothioglucose (Solganol), gold sodium thiomalate
(Aurolate) and auranofin (Ridaura).
• Slow-Acting Antirheumatic Drugs (SAARDs). SAARDs
are a special class of DMARDs and the effect of these
drugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as that
of the NSAIDs. Examples are hydroxychloroquine and
aurothioglucose.
• Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs. This class of drugs
is used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs have
no effect. Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizing
effect on the immune system. Since the inflammation
associated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctions
of the immune system, use of this class of drugs has
been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis as well. Examples are: methotrex-
ate, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambu-
cil, and azathioprine.
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of drug.
The prescribing physician or the pharmacist provide
information for the correct dosage. The drugs must be
taken exactly as directed.
When taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis,
it should be taken only once or twice a week as pre-
scribed,not every day. Taking it every day can lead to a
fatal overdose.
Precautions
Many antirheumatic drugs such as, for example, aza-
thioprine (Imuran) and methotrexate (Rheumatrex), are very

when all other treatments have failed. Thus, they may have
serious side effects, so it is important to be monitored close-
ly by a physician while taking any of these drugs.
Side effects
Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may cause vision
problems. Anyone taking it should see an ophthalmolo-
gist (a physician who specializes in treating eyes) for a
thorough eye examinationevery six months.
Methotrexate and penicillamine may cause birth
defects. Women taking these drugs must stop taking
them during pregnancyand for several months before a
planned pregnancy. Methotrexate may also cause lung
damage or fertility problems and should not be taken by

ing these drugs should have regular blood counts.
Entanercept (Enbrel) may also cause blood prob-
lems, and some patients who received this drug have
developed eye problems and multiple sclerosis. It is not
certain whether these reactions were caused by entaner-
cept, but multiple sclerosis has been seen in patients tak-
ing other drugs which act against tumor necrosis factor.
Interactions
Antirheumatic drugs may interact with a variety of
other medicines or other antirheumatic drugs. When this
happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs may
change, or the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyone
who takes this type of drug should inform the prescribing
physician about any other medication he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with antirheumatic
drugs are phenytoin (Dilantin),aspirin, sulfa drugs such
as Bactrim and Gantrisin, tetracycline and some other
antibioticsand cimetidine (Tagamet). NSAIDs such as
ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are also known to interact with
other classes of antirheumatic drugs.

Antiseptics
Definition
An antiseptic is a substance which inhibits the
growth and development of microorganisms. For practi-
cal purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topi-
cal agents, for application to skin, mucous membranes,
and inanimate objects, although a formal definition
includes agents which are used internally, such as the uri-
nary tract antiseptics.
Purpose
Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are
applied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for their
anti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal or
bacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing of skin and
wound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfaces
prior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disin-
fection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oral
hygiene. Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani-
mate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces.
Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include
benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine,
iodine compounds, mercury compounds, alcohol and
hydrogen peroxide. Other agents which have been used
for this purpose, but have largely been supplanted by
more effective or safer agents, include boric acid and
volatile oils such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen.)
Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when
applied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oral
rinses and preoperative total body washes.
Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used
primarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium may
also find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments,
and in low concentration as a preservative for drugs includ-
ing ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inacti-
vated by organic compounds, including soap, and must not
be applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed.
Iodine compounds include tincture of iodine and
povidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have the
broadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with action
against bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa, and
yeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its alcoholic
component is drying and extremely irritating when applied
to abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin. Povidone iodine, an
organic compound, is less irritating and less toxic, but not
as effective. Povidone iodine has been used for hand
scrubs and disinfection of surgical sites. Aqueous solu-
tions of iodine have also been used as antiseptic agents,
but are less effective than alcoholic solutions and less con-
venient to use that the povidone iodine compounds.
Hydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of
oxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydro-
gen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygen
bubbles produces an effervescent action, which may be
useful for wound cleansing through removal of tissue
debris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may be
reduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropri-
ate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic use
is 3%, although higher concentrations are available.
Thimerosol (Mersol) is a mercury compound with
activity against bacteria and yeasts. Prolonged use may
result in mercury toxicity.
Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with product and intended use. Con-
sult individualized references.
Precautions
Precautions vary with individual product and use.
Consult individualized references.

with organic compounds such as chlorhexidine, benza-
lkonium and hexachlorophine.
Skin dryness and irritation should be considered with
all products, but particularly with those containing alcohol.
Systemic toxicity may result from ingestion of
iodine containing compounds or mercury compounds.
Chlorhexidine should not be instilled into the ear.
There is one anecdotal report of deafness following use of
chlorhexidine in a patient with a perforated eardrum.
Safety in pregnancyand breastfeeding have not been
reported, however there is one anecdotal report of an
infant developing slowed heartbeat apparently related to
maternal use of chlorhexidine.
Iodine compounds should be used sparingly during
pregnancy and lactationdue to risk of infant absorption
of iodine with alterations in thyroid function.
Interactions
Antiseptics are not known to interact with any other
medicines. However, they should not be used together
with any other topical cream, solution, or ointment.

Antispasmodic drugs
Definition
Antispasmodic drugs relieve cramps or spasms of
the stomach, intestines, and bladder.
KEY TERMS
Antibiotic—A medicine used to treat infections.
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause
many diseases and infections.
Mucous membrane—The moist lining of a body
cavity or structure, such as the mouth or nose.
Residue—Traces that remain after most of the rest
of the material is gone.
Purpose
Antispasmodic drugs have been used to treat stom-
ach cramps. Traditionally, they were used to treat stom-
ach ulcers, but for this purpose they have largely been
replaced by the acid inhibiting compoundsa, the H-2
receptor blockers such as cimetidine and ranitidine and
the proton pump inhibtors such as omeprazole, lansopra-
zole and rabetazole.
Most of the drugs used for this purpose as “anti-
cholinergics”, since they counteract the effects of the
neurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs are
derived from the plant belladonna, also known as Deadly
Nightshade. There is also a group of drugs with similar
activity, but not taken from plant sources. The anti-
cholingergics decrease both the movements of the stom-
ach and intestine, and also the secretions of stomach acid
and digestive enzymes. They may be used for other pur-
poses including treatment of Parkinson’s Disease, and
bladder urgency. Because these drugs inhibit secretions,
they cause dry mouthand dry eyes because of reduced
salivation and tearing. Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic
with very lettle effect on secretions. It is used to treat
irritable bowel syndrome.
Description
Dicyclomine is available only with a prescription
and is sold as capsules, tablets (regular and extended-
release forms), and syrup.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults is 20 mg, four times a
day. However, the physician may recommend starting at
a lower dosage and gradually increasing the dose to
reduce the chance of unwanted side effects.
The dosage for children depends on the child’s age.
Check with the child’s physician for the correct dosage.
Precautions
Dicyclomine makes some people sweat less, which
allows the body to overheat and may lead to heat prostra-
tion (feverand heat stroke). Anyone taking this drug
should try to avoid extreme heat. If that is not possible,
check with the physician who prescribed the drug. If heat
prostration occurs, stop taking the medicine and call a
physician immediately.
This medicine can cause drowsiness and blurred or
double vision. People who take this drug should not
drive, use machines, or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the medicine
affects them.

• hyperthyroidism
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsi-
ness, lightheadedness, nausea, nervousness, blurred
vision, dry mouth, and weakness. Other side effects may
occur. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after taking
dicyclomine should get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Dicyclomine may interact with other medicines.
When this happens, the effects of one or both of the
drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Among the drugs that may interact with Dicy-
clomine are:
• antacids such as Maalox
• antihistamines such as clemastine fumarate (Tavist)
• bronchodilators (airway opening drugs) such as albu-
terol (Proventil, Ventolin)
• corticosteroids such as prednisone (Deltasone)
• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such
as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate)
• tranquilizers such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazo-
lam (Xanax)
KEY TERMS
Heat stroke—A serious condition that results from
exposure to extreme heat. The body loses its abili-
ty to cool itself. Severe headache, high fever, and
hot, dry skin may result. In severe cases, a person
with heat stroke may collapse or go into a coma.
Hiatal hernia—A condition in which part of the
stomach protrudes through the diaphragm.

Antituberculosis drugs
Definition
Antituberculosis drugs are medicines used to treat
tuberculosis, an infectious disease that can affect the
lungs and other organs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	309
Antituberculosis drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 309  Purpose
Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculae, a bacteria that is passed between people
through the air. The disease can be cured with proper
drug therapy, but because the bacteria may become resis-
tant to any single drug, combinations of antituberculosis
drugs are used to treat tuberculosis (TB) are normally
required for effective treatment. At the start of the 20th
Century, tuberculosis was the most common cause of
deathin the United States, but was laregly eliminated
with better living conditions. It is most common in areas
of crowding and poor ventilation, suich as crowded
urban areas and prisons. In some areas, the AIDSepi-
demic has been accompanied by an increase in the preva-
lence of tuberculosis.
Some antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat or
prevent other infections such as Mycobacterium avium
complex (MAC), which causes disease throughout the
bodies of people with AIDS or other diseases of the
immune system.
Description
Antituberculosis drugs are available only with a
physician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liq-
uid and injectable forms. Some commonly used antitu-
berculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin), ethambu-
tol (Myambutol), ethionamide (Trecator-SC), isoniazid
(Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide, rifabutin
(Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antituberculosis drug and may be different for different
patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the
medicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescription
for the proper dosage. The physician may gradually
increase the dosage during treatment. Be sure to follow
the physician’s orders. Patients who are infected with
HIV must usually take larger combinations of drugs for a
longer period of time than is needed for patients with an
unimpaired immune system.
Some antituberculosis drugs must be taken with
other drugs. If they are taken alone, they may encourage
the bacteria that cause tuberculosis to become resistant to
drugs used to treat the disease. When the bacteria become
resistant, treating the disease becomes more difficult.
To clear up tuberculosis completely, antituberculosis
drugs must be taken for as long as directed. This may
mean taking the medicine every day for a year or two or
even longer. Symptoms may improve very quickly after
treatment with this medicine begins. However, they may
come back if the medicine is stopped too quickly. Do not
stop taking the medicine just because symptoms improve.
Because people may neglect to take their medication
for tuberculosis, it is common to have tuberculosis centers
develop a program of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT.)
In these programs, patients come to the hospital or clinic,
and take their medication in front of an observer. These
programs may be annoying to the patients, but are justi-
fied by the risks to public health if tuberculosis germs
which have become resistant to drugs were to be spread.
Cycloserine works best when it is at constant levels
in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the medi-
cine in doses spaced evenly through the day and night.
Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine at night inter-
feres with sleep, or if it is difficult to remember to take
the medicine during the day, check with a health care
professional for suggestions.
Do not take antacidsthat contain aluminum, such as
Maalox, within 1 hour of taking isoniazid, as this may
keep the medicine from working.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking antituber-
culosis drugs is important. The physician will check to
make sure the medicine is working as it should and will
watch for unwanted side effects. These visits also will
help the physician know if the dosage needs to be
changed.
Symptoms should begin to improve within a few
weeks after treatment begins with antituberculosis drugs.
If they do not, or if they become worse, check with a
physician.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, or less
alert when using these drugs. Some may also cause
vision changes, clumsiness, or unsteadiness. Because of
these possible problems, anyone who takes antitubercu-
losis drugs should not drive, use machines, or do any-
thing else that might be dangerous until they have found
out how the medicine affects them.
Daily doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B
6) may lessen
or prevent some side effects of ethionamide or isoniazid.
If the physician who prescribed the medicine recom-
mends this, be sure to take the pyridoxine every day.
Certain kinds of cheese (such as Swiss and Cheshire)
and fish (such as tuna and skipjack) may cause an unusual
reaction in people taking isoniazid. Symptoms of this
reaction include fast or pounding heartbeat, sweating or a
hot feeling, chills or a clammy feeling,headache, light-
headedness, and red or itchy skin. This reaction is very
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2310
Antituberculosis drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 310  rare. However, if any of these symptoms occur, check
with a physician as soon as possible.
Rifabutin and rifampin will make saliva, sweat, tears,
urine, feces, and skin turn reddish orange to reddish brown.
This is nothing to worry about. However, the discolored
tears may permanently stain soft contact lenses (but not
hard contact lenses). To avoid ruining contact lenses, do not
wear soft contacts while taking these medicines.
Rifampin may temporarily lower the number of
white blood cells. Because the white blood cells are
important in fighting infection, this effect increases the
chance of getting an infection. This drug also may lower
the number of platelets that play an important role in
clotting. To reduce the risk of bleeding and infection in
the mouth while taking this medicine, be especially care-
ful when brushing and flossing the teeth. Check with a
physician or dentist for suggestions on how to keep the
teeth and mouth clean without causing injuries. Put off
any dental work until blood counts return to normal.
Rifampin may affect the results of some medical tests.
Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine
should alert the health care professional in charge.
People who have certain medical conditions may
have problems if they take antituberculosis drugs. For
example:
• cycloserine or isoniazid may increase the risk of
seizures (convulsions) in people with a history of
seizures.
• the dosage of cycloserine may need to be adjusted for
people with kidney disease.
• ethambutol or pyrazinamide may cause or worsen
attacks of goutin people who are prone to having them.
• ethambutol may cause or worsen eye damage.
• diabetes may be harder to control in patients who take
ethionamide.
• isoniazid may cause false results on some urine sugar
tests, and pyrazinamide may cause false results on urine
ketone tests. Diabetic patients who either of these medi-
cines should discuss the possibility of false test results
with their physicians.
• people with liver disease or a history of alcohol abuse
may be more likely to develop hepatitis when taking
isoniazid and are more likely to have side effects that
affect the liver when taking rifampin.
• in people with kidney disease, ethambutol, ethion-
amide, or isoniazid may be more likely to cause side
effects.
• side effects are also more likely in people with liver dis-
ease who take pyrazinamide.
Before taking antituberculosis drugs, be sure to let
the physician know about these or any other medical
problems.
In laboratory tests of pregnant animals, high doses of
some antituberculosis drugs have caused birth defects
and other problems in the fetus or newborn. However,
pregnant women with tuberculosis need to take antituber-
culosis drugs to clear up their disease. Knowing that many
women have had healthy babies after taking these drugs
during pregnancymay be reassuring. Pregnant women
who need to take this medicine and are worried about birth
defects or other problems should talk to their physicians.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antituber-
culosis drugs or to niacin should let his or her physician
know before taking any antituberculosis drug. The physi-
cian should also be told about any allergiesto foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Patients who are on special diets, such as low-sodi-
um or low-sugar diets, should make sure their physicians
know. Some antituberculosis medicines may contain
sodium, sugar, or alcohol.
Side effects
Cycloserine
In some people, this medicine causes depression and
thoughts of suicide. If this happens, check with a physi-
cian immediately. Switching to another medicine will
usually stop these troubling thoughts and feelings. Also
let the physician know immediately about any other mood
or mental changes; such as nervousness, nightmares,anx-
iety, confusion, or irritability; and about symptoms such
as muscle twitches, convulsions, or speech problems.
Headache is a common side effect that usually goes
away as the body adjusts to this medicine. This problem
does not need medical attention unless it continues or it
interferes with everyday life.
Ethambutol
This medicine may cause eye painor vision
changes, including loss of vision or changes in color
vision. Check with a physician immediately if any of
these problems develop.
In addition, anyone who has any of these symptoms
while taking ethambutol should check with a physician
immediately:
• painful or swollen joints, especially in the knee, ankle,
or big toe
• a tight, hot sensation in the skin over painful or swollen
joints
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	311

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 311  • chills
Other side effects may occur but do not need med-
ical attention unless they are bothersome or they do not
go away as the body adjusts to the medicine. These
include: headache, confusion,nausea and vomiting,
stomach pain, and loss of appetite.
Ethionamide
Check with a physician immediately if eye pain,
blurred vision, or other vision changes occur while tak-
ing this medicine.
Symptoms such as unsteadiness, clumsiness and
pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands or feet
could be the first signs of nerve problems that may
become more serious. If any of these symptoms occur,
check with a physician immediately. Other side effects
that should be brought to a physician’s attention immedi-
ately include yellow eyes or skin and mood or mental
changes such as depression or confusion.
Less serious side effects such as dizziness, nausea or
vomiting, appetite loss, sore mouth, or metallic taste may
also occur. These problems usually go away as the body
adjusts to the medicine. They do not need medical atten-
tion unless they continue or they interfere with normal
activities.
Isoniazid
This medicine may cause serious liver damage,
especially in people over 40 years of age. However, tak-
ing medicine for tuberculosis is very important for peo-
ple with the disease. Anyone who has tuberculosis and
has been advised to take this drug should thoroughly dis-
cuss treatment options with his or her physician.
Recognizing the early signs of liver and nerve dam-
age can help prevent the problems from getting worse. If
any of these symptoms occur, check with a physician
immediately:
• unusual tiredness or weakness
• clumsiness or unsteadiness
• pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and
feet
• loss of appetite
• vomiting
This medicine may also cause less serious side
effects such as diarrheaand stomach pain. These usual-
ly go away as the body adjusts to the medicine and do not
need medical attention unless they continue.
If eye pain, blurred vision, or other vision changes
occur while taking this medicine, check with a physician
immediately.
Pyrazinamide
Check with a physician immediately if pain in the
joints occurs.
Rifabutin
Check with a physician immediately if a skin rash
occurs.
Nausea and vomiting are other possible side effects
of this medicine. These problems usually go away as the
body adjusts to the medicine. If they do not, check with a
physician.
Rifampin
Stop taking rifampin and check with a physician
immediately if any of the following symptoms occur.
These symptoms could be early signs of problems that
may become more serious. Getting prompt medical
attention could prevent them from getting worse.
• unusual tiredness or weakness
• nausea or vomiting
• loss of appetite
In addition, anyone who has any of these symptoms
while taking rifampin should check with a physician
immediately:
• breathing problems
•fever
• chills
• shivering
• headache
• dizziness
• itching
• skin rash or redness
• muscle and bone pain
Other side effects, such as diarrhea and stomach
pain, may occur with this medicine, but should go away
as the body adjusts to the drug. Medical treatment is not
necessary unless these problems continue.
Other side effects may occur with any antituberculo-
sis drug. Anyone who has unusual symptoms while tak-
ing an antituberculosis drug should get in touch with his

Drinking alcohol regularly may prevent isoniazid
from working properly and may increase the chance of
liver damage. Anyone taking this medicine should strict-
ly limit the use of alcohol. Check with a health care pro-
fessional for advice on the amount of alcohol that may
safely be used.
Many drugs may interact with isoniazid or rifampin,
increasing the chance of liver damage or other side
effects. Among these drugs are acetaminophen
(Tylenol), birth control pills and other drugs that contain
female hormones, and the antiseizure drugs divalproex
(Depakote) and valproic acid (Depakene). For a com-
plete list of drugs that may have this effect, check with a
pharmacist.
Isoniazid may also decrease the effects of the anti-
fungal drug ketoconazole (Nizoral) and the antitubercu-
losis drug rifampin (Rifadin).
Rifampin may make many drugs less effective.
Among the drugs that may be affected are diabetes medi-
cines taken by mouth (oral hypoglycemics), digitalis
heart drugs, many antifungal drugs, and birth control
pills. Because it makes birth control pills less effective,
taking rifampin may increase the chance of becoming

Antiulcer drugs
Definition
Antiulcer drugs are a class of drugs, exclusive of the
antibacterial agents, used to treat ulcers in the stomach
and the upper part of the small intestine.
Purpose
Recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers are caused by
Helicobacter pyloriinfections, and are treated with com-
bination treatments that incorporate antibiotic therapy
with gastric acid suppression. Additionally, bismuth
compounds have been used. The primary class of drugs
used for gastric acid suppression are the proton pump
inhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and
rabeprazole. The H-2 receptor blocking agents, cimeti-
dine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine have been used
for this purpose, but are now more widely used for mainte-
nance therapy after treatment with the proton pump
inhibitors. Sucralfate, which acts by forming a protective
coating over the ulcerate lesion, is also used in ulcer treat-
ment and may be appropriate for patients in whom other
classes of drugs are not indicated, or those whose gastric
ulcers are caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) rather than H. pyloriinfections.
Description
The proton pump inhibitors block the secretion of
gastric acid by the gastric parietal cells. The extent of inhi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	313
Antiulcer drugs
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 313  bition of acid secretion is dose related. In some cases, gas-
tric acid secretion is completely blocked for over 24 hours
on a single dose. In addition to their role in treatment of
gastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treat
syndromes of excessive acid secretion (Zollinger-Ellison
Syndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Histamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action of
histamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secre-
tion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective than the
proton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a 75–79% reduc-
tion in acid secretion. Higher rates of acid inhibition may
be achieved when the drug is administered by the intra-
venous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be used
to treat heartburnand hypersecretory syndromes. When
given before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are useful
in prevention of aspiration pneumonia.
Sucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar molecule
with no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid, but
rather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a thick
coating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting the
open area from further damage. A secondary effect is to
act as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme pepsin. Sucral-
fate does not bind to the normal stomach lining. The drug
has been used for prevention of stressulcers, the type
seen in patients exposed to physical stress such as burns
and surgery. It has no systemic effects.
Recommended dosage
The doses of the proton pump inhibitors and H-2
receptor blockers vary depending on the drug and condi-
tion being treated. Consult individual references.
The dose of sucralfate for acute ulcer therapy is 1
gram four times a day. After the ulcer has healed, mainte-
nance treatment may continue at 1 gram two times daily.
Precautions
The proton pump inhibitors are generally well toler-
ated, and the most common adverse effects are diarrhea,
itching, skin rash,dizzinessand headache. Muscle
aches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infec-
tions are among the other adverse reactions reported.
Omeprazole has an increased rate of fetal deaths in ani-
mal studies. It is not known if these drugs are excreted in
human milk, but because of reported adverse effects to
infants in animal studies, it is recommended that proton
pump inhibitors not be used by nursing mothers.
The H-2 receptor blockers vary widely in their
adverse effects. Although they are generally well tolerat-
ed, cimetidine may cause confusion in elderly patients,
and has an antiandrogenic effect that may cause sexual
dysfunctionin males. Famotidine has been reported to
cause headache in 4.7% of patients. It is advisable that
mothers not take H-2 receptor blockers while nursing.
Sucralfate is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed,
and its most common side effect is constipationin 2% of
patients. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort,
indigestion, flatulence,dry mouth, rash, pruritus (itch-
ing), back pain, headache, dizziness, sleepiness, and ver-
tigo have been reported, as well as rare allergic respons-
es. Because sucralfate releases small amounts of alu-
minum into the system, it should be used with caution in
patients with renal insufficiency. There is no information
available about sucralfate’s safety in breastfeeding.
Interactions
Proton pump inhibitors may increase the pH of the
stomach. This will inactivate some antifungal drugs that
require an acid medium for effectiveness, notable itra-
conazole and ketoconazole.
H-2 receptor blocking agents have a large number of
drug interactions. Consult individualized references.
Sucralfate should not be used with aluminum con-
taining antacids, because of the risk of increased alu-
minum absorption. Sucralfate may inhibit absorption and
reduce blood levels of anticoagulants, digoxin, quinidine,
ketoconazole, quinolones and phenytoin.

Antiviral drugs
Definition
Antiviral drugs are medicines that cure or control
virus infections.
Purpose
Antivirals are used to treat infections caused by
viruses. Unlike antibacterial drugs, which may cover a
wide range of pathogens, antiviral agents tend to be nar-
row in spectrum, and have limited efficacy.
Description
Exclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV
(AIDS) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviral
drugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir
(Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Val-
trex) are effective against herpesvirus, including herpes
zoster and herpes genitalis. They may also be of value in
either conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpox
and shingles. These drugs are not curative, but may
reduce the painof a herpes outbreak and shorten the
period of viral shedding.
Amantadine (Symmetrel), oseltamivir (Tamiflu),
rimantidine (Flumadine), and zanamivir (Relenza) are
useful in treatment of influenzavirus. Amantadine,
rimantadine, and oseltamivir may be administered
throughout the flu season as preventatives for patients
who cannot take influenza virus vaccine.
Cidofovir (Vistide), foscarnet (Foscavir), and ganci-
clovir (Cytovene) have been beneficial in treatment of
cytomegalovirus in immunosupressed patients, primarily
HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Ribavirin
(Virazole) is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus. In
combination with interferons, ribavirin has shown some
efficacy against hepatitis C, and there have been anecdo-
tal reports of utility against other types of viral infections.
As a class, the antivirals are not curative, and must be
used either prophylactically or early in the development
of an infection. Their mechanism of action is typically to
inactivate the enzymes needed for viral replication. This
will reduce the rate of viral growth, but will not inactive
the virus already present. Antiviral therapy must normally
be initiated within 48 hours of the onset of an infection to
provide any benefit. Drugs used for influenza may be
used throughout the influenza season in high risk patients,
or within 48 hours of exposure to a known carrier. Anti-
herpetic agents should be used at the first signs of an out-
break. Anti-cytomegaloviral drugs must routinely be used
as part of a program of secondary prophylaxis(mainte-

prevent reinfection in immunocompromised patients.
Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with the drug, patient age and condi-
tion, route of administration, and other factors. See spe-
cific references.
Precautions
Ganciclovir is available in intravenous injection, oral
capsules, and intraoccular inserts. The capsules should be
reserved for prophylactic use in organ transplant patients,
or for HIV infected patients who cannot be treated with
the intravenous drug. The toxicity profile of this drug
when administered systemically includes granulocytope-
nia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The drug is in preg-
nancycategory C, but has caused significant fetal abnor-
malities in animal studies including cleft palate and organ
defects. Breast feeding is not recommended.
Cidofovir causes renal toxicity in 53% of patients.
Patients should be well hydrated, and renal function
should be checked regularly. Other common adverse
effects are nausea and vomitingin 65% or patients,
asthenia in 46% and headacheand diarrhea, both
reported in 27% of cases. The drug is category C in preg-
nancy, due to fetal abnormalities in animal studies.
Breast feeding is not recommended.
Foscarnet is used in treatment of immunocompro-
mised patients with cytomegalovirus infections and in
acyclovir-resistant herpes simples virus. The primary
hazard is renal toxicity. Alterations in electrolyte levels
may cause seizures. Foscarnet is category C during preg-
nancy. The drug has caused skeletal abnormailities in
developing fetuses. It is not known whether foscarnet is
excreted in breast milk, however the drug does appear in
breast milk in animal studies.
Valaciclovir is metabolized to acyclovir, so that the
hazards of the two drugs are very similar. They are gener-
ally well tolerated, but nausea and headache are common
adverse effects. They are both pregnancy category B.
Although there have been no reports of fetal abnormali-
ties attributable to either drug, the small number of report-
ed cases makes it impossible to draw conclusions regard-
ing safety in pregnancy. Acyclovir is found in breast milk,
but no adverse effects have been reported in the newborn.
Famciclovir is similar in actions and adverse effects.
Ribavirin is used by aerosol for treatment of hospital-
ized infants and young children with severe lower respira-
tory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV). When administered orally, the drug has been used
in adultys to treat other viral diseases including acute and

Anxiety
Definition
Anxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived
threat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemical
changes in the body, the patient’s personal history and
memory, and the social situation. As far as we know, anxi-
ety is a uniquely human experience. Other animals clearly
know fear, but human anxiety involves an ability, to use
memory and imagination to move backward and forward
in time, that animals do not appear to have. The anxiety
that occurs in post-traumatic syndromes indicates that
human memory is a much more complicated mental func-
tion than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion of
human anxiety is produced by anticipation of future
events. Without a sense of personal continuity over time,
people would not have the “raw materials” of anxiety.
It is important to distinguish between anxiety as a
feeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a psy-
chiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious without
having an anxiety disorder. Also a person facing a clear
and present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con-
sidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxiety
frequently occurs as a symptom in other categories of	psychiatric disturbance.
Description
Although anxiety is a commonplace experience that
everyone has from time to time, it is difficult to describe
concretely because it has so many different potential caus-
es and degrees of intensity. Doctors sometimes categorize
anxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether it
is being described by the person having it (emotion) or by
an outside observer (affect). The word emotionis general-
ly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state that
underlie a person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affectis used
to describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’s
perspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an anxious
affect, he or she means that the patient appears nervous or
anxious, or responds to others in an anxious way (for
example, the individual is shaky, tremulous, etc.).
Although anxiety is related to fear, it is not the same
thing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific event
or object, and the person is consciously aware of it. Most
people will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun at
them or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon. They
also will recognize that they are afraid. Anxiety, on the
other hand, is often unfocused, vague, and hard to pin
down to a specific cause. In this form it is called free-float-
ing anxiety. Sometimes anxiety being experienced in the
present may stem from an event or person that produced
painand fear in the past, but the anxious individual is not
consciously aware of the original source of the feeling. It
is anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes it hard for
people to compare their experiences of it. Whereas most
people will be fearful in physically dangerous situations,
and can agree that fear is an appropriate response in the
presence of danger, anxiety is often triggered by objects or
events that are unique and specific to an individual. An
individual might be anxious because of a unique meaning
or memory being stimulated by present circumstances, not
because of some immediate danger. Another individual
looking at the anxious person from the outside may be
truly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s anxiety.
Causes and symptoms
Anxiety can have a number of different causes. It is
a multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s
environment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for
example, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum-
bling) resulting from a combination of general biological
and individual psychological processes.
Physical
In some cases, anxiety is produced by physical respons-
es to stress, or by certain disease processes or medications.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	317
Anxiety
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 317  THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The ner-
vous system of human beings is “hard-wired” to respond
to dangers or threats. These responses are not subject to
conscious control, and are the same in humans as in
lower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptation
to the animal predators and other dangers with which all
animals, including primitive humans, had to cope. The
most familiar reaction of this type is the so-called “fight-
or-flight” reaction. This response is the human organ-
ism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation.
It is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousal
marked by high muscle tension and strong feelings of
fear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac-
tion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises.
They become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate,
their heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases,
and their digestion slows down, allowing more energy to
be available to the muscles.
This emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the
nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, or
ANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-
cialized part of the brainstem that is among a group of
structures called the limbic system. The limbic system
controls human emotions through its connections to
glands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and
“higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor-
tex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbic
system cannot tell the difference between a realistic
physical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.
The hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-
mones by the pituitary gland, even when there is no
external and objective danger. A second problem is
caused by the biochemical side effects of too many “false
alarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a real
danger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones by
running away or by fighting. In modern life, however,
people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations in
which they can neither run away nor lash out physically.
As a result, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi-
cal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them.
These biochemical changes can produce anxious feel-
ings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp-
toms associated with anxiety. They may even produce
permanent changes in the brain, if the process occurs
repeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such as
coronary artery disease, may be worsened by anxiety,
as chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart,
stomach, and other organs.
DISEASES AND DISORDERS.Anxiety can be a symp-
tom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis-
eases are disorders of the endocrine system, such as
Cushing’s syndrome(overproduction of cortisol by the
adrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity of the
thyroid gland. Other medical conditions that can produce
anxiety include respiratory distress syndrome,mitral
valve prolapse, porphyria, and chest pain caused by
inadequate blood supply to the heart (anginapectoris).
MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous
medications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a side
effect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid or
asthmadrugs; some psychotropic agents; occasionally,
local anesthetics; corticosteroids; antihypertensive
drugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(like
flurbiprofen and ibuprofen).
Although people do not usually think of caffeineas
a drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con-
sumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf-
feine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,
coffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially cola
beverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptoms
simply by reducing their intake of these substances.
Withdrawal from certain prescription drugs, primari-
ly beta blockersand corticosteroids, can cause anxiety.
Withdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD,
cocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety.
Learned associations
Some aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable
byproducts of the human developmental process.
Humans are unique among animals in that they spend an
unusually long period of early life in a relatively helpless
condition, and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxi-
ety. The extended period of human dependency on adults
means that people may remember, and learn to antici-
pate, frightening or upsetting experiences long before
they are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery over
their environment. In addition, the fact that anxiety dis-
ordersoften run in families indicates that children can
learn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents, as
well as healthy ones. Also, recurrent disorders in families
may indicate that there is a genetic or inherited compo-
nent in some anxiety disorders. For example, there has
been found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders
(panic) in identical twins than in fraternal twins.
CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY. Re-
searchers in early childhood development regard anxiety
in adult life as a residue of childhood memories of
dependency. Humans learn during the first year of life
that they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur-
vival depends on the care of others. It is thought that this
early experience of helplessness underlies the most com-
mon anxieties of adult life, including fear of powerless-
ness and fear of being unloved. Thus, adults can be made
anxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2318
Anxiety
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 318  and/or significant relationships, even though they are no
longer helpless children.
SYMBOLIZATION.The psychoanalytic model gives
considerable weight to the symbolic aspect of human
anxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,
compulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highly
individualized. The length of the human maturation
process allows many opportunities for children and ado-
lescents to connect their experiences with certain objects
or events that can bring back feelings in later life. For
example, a person who was frightened as a child by a tall
man wearing glasses may feel panicky years later by
something that reminds him of that person or experience
without consciously knowing why.
Freud thought that anxiety results from a person’s
internal conflicts. According to his theory, people feel
anxious when they feel torn between desires or urges
toward certain actions, on the one hand, and moral
restrictions, on the other. In some cases, the person’s
anxiety may attach itself to an object that represents the
inner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxious
around money may be pulled between a desire to steal
and the belief that stealing is wrong. Money becomes a
symbol for the inner conflict between doing what is con-
sidered right and doing what one wants.
PHOBIAS.Phobiasare a special type of anxiety
reaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated on
a specific object or situation that the person then tries to
avoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of all pro-
portion to its “cause.” Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders,4th edition (DSM-IV),
these specific phobias were called simple phobias. It is
estimated that 10-11% of the population will develop a
phobia in the course of their lives. Some phobias, such as
agoraphobia(fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear
of small or confined spaces), and social phobia, are
shared by large numbers of people. Others are less com-
mon or unique to the patient.
Social and environmental stressors
Anxiety often has a social dimension because
humans are social creatures. People frequently report
feelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and, there-
fore, fear the loss of social approval or love. Social phobia
is a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levels
of anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations.
Another social stressor is prejudice. People who
belong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher risk
for developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, for
example, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis-
orderamong women reflects their greater social and
economic vulnerability.
Some controversial studies indicate that the increase
in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in news
reports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level of
many people. Stress and anxiety management programs
often suggest that patients cut down their exposure to
upsetting stimuli.
Anxiety may also be caused by environmental or
occupational factors. People who must live or work
around sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,
chemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannot
avoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.
Existential anxiety
Another factor that shapes human experiences of
anxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans are
the only animals that appear to be aware of their limited
life span. Some researchers think that awareness of
deathinfluences experiences of anxiety from the time
that a person is old enough to understand death.

In order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of
anxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of its
symptoms.
SOMATIC.The somatic or physical symptoms of
anxiety include headaches,dizzinessor lightheadedness,
nausea and/or vomiting,diarrhea, tingling, pale com-
plexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, and
sensations of tightness in the chest, neck, shoulders, or
hands. These symptoms are produced by the hormonal,
muscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in the
fight-or-flight reaction.
BEHAVIORAL.Behavioral symptoms of anxiety
include pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper-
ventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or finger
tapping.
COGNITIVE.Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include
recurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor-
bid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion, or
inability to concentrate.
EMOTIONAL.Feeling states associated with anxiety
include tension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or
“keyed up,” and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.
DEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,
the symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from or
activate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms.
Because of these defenses, it is possible for a person to
be anxious without being consciously aware of it or
appearing anxious to others. These psychological defens-
es include:

Anxiety
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 319  • Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts or
ideas out of conscious awareness.
• Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached to a
different object or event. Phobias are an example of the
mechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory.
• Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious feel-
ings by saying that any normal person would feel anx-
ious in their situation.
• Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of phys-
ical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrent
headaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.
• Delusion formation. The person converts anxious feel-
ings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas without
reality testing. Delusion formation can involve groups
as well as individuals.
Other theorists attribute some drug addictionto the
desire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,
they argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub-
stances or behaviors to “medicate” anxious feelings.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex
because of the variety of its causes and the highly personal-
ized and individualized nature of its symptom formation.
There are no medical tests that can be used to diagnose
anxiety by itself. When a doctor examines an anxious
patient, he or she will first rule out physical conditions and
diseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from these
exclusions, the physical examinationis usually inconclu-
sive. Some anxious patients may have their blood pressure
or pulse rate affected by anxiety, or may look pale or per-
spire heavily, but others may appear physically completely
normal. The doctor will then take the patient’s medication,
dietary, and occupational history to see if they are taking
prescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if they are
abusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs, if they are con-
suming large amounts of caffeine, or if their workplace is
noisy or dangerous. In most cases, the most important
source of diagnostic information is the patient’s psycholog-
ical and social history. The doctor may administer a brief
psychological test to help evaluate the intensity of the
patient’s anxiety and some of its features. Some tests that
are often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doc-
tors will check a number of chemical factors in the blood,
such as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.
Treatment
Not all patients with anxiety require treatment, but
for more severe cases, treatment is recommended.
Because anxiety often has more than one cause and is
experienced in highly individual ways, its treatment usu-
ally requires more than one type of therapy. In addition,
there is no way to tell in advance how patients will
respond to a specific drug or therapy. Sometimes the doc-
tor will need to try different medications or methods of
treatment before finding the best combination for the
particular patient. It usually takes about six to eight
weeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of a
treatment regimen.
Medications
Medications are often prescribed to relieve the phys-
ical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most agents
work by counteracting the biochemical and muscular
changes involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Some
work directly on the chemicals in the brain that are
thought to underlie the anxiety.
ANXIOLYTICS.Anxiolytics are sometimes called
tranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi-
azepinesor barbiturates. Barbiturates, once commonly
used, are now rarely used in clinical practice. Barbitu-
rates work by slowing down the transmission of nerve
impulses from the brain to other parts of the body. They
include such drugs as phenobarbital (Luminal) and pen-
tobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relax-
ing the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic system.
They include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide (Librium)
and diazepam (Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodi-
azepines are potentially habit-forming and may cause
withdrawal symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far less
likely than barbiturates to cause physical dependency.
Both drugs also increase the effects of alcohol and
should never be taken in combination with it.
Two other types of anxiolytic medications include
meprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, and
buspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that appears
to work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s own
emotion-regulating brain chemicals. Buspirone has sever-
al advantages over other anxiolytics. It does not cause
dependence problems, does not interact with alcohol, and
does not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operate
machinery. However, buspirone is not effective against
certain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder.
ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some
anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor-
derand panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat
depression,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment of
choice. Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms of
depression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant med-
ications for anxious/depressed patients. While SSRIs are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2320
Anxiety
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 320  more common, antidepressants are sometimes pre-
scribed, including tricyclic antidepressants such as
imipramine (Tofranil) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAO inhibitors) such as phenelzine (Nardil).
Beta-blockers are medications that work by blocking
the body’s reaction to the stress hormones that are
released during the fight-or-flight reaction. They include
drugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin).
Beta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post-
traumatic anxiety symptoms. More commonly, the beta-
blockers are given to patients with a mild form of social
phobic anxiety, such as fear of public speaking.
Psychotherapy
Most patients with anxiety will be given some form of
psychotherapy along with medications. Many patients
benefit from insight-oriented therapies, which are
designed to help them uncover unconscious conflicts and
defense mechanisms in order to understand how their
symptoms developed. Patients who are extremely anxious
may benefit from supportive psychotherapy, which aims at
symptom reduction rather than personality restructuring.
Two newer approaches that work well with anxious
patients are cognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT), and
relaxation training. In CBT, the patient is taught to identify
the thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxi-
ety, and to view them more realistically. In the behavioral
part of the program, the patient is exposed to the anxiety-
provoking object, situation, or internal stimulus (like a
rapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desen-
sitized to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimes
called anxiety management training, includes breathing
exercises and similar techniques intended to help the
patient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscle
tension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction. Both
CBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapy
as well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, sup-
port groups are often helpful to anxious patients, because
they provide a social network and lessen the embarrass-
ment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms.
Psychosurgery
Surgery on the brain is very rarely recommended for
patients with anxiety; however, some patients with severe
cases of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) have
been helped by an operation on a part of the brain that is
involved in OCD. Normally, this operation is attempted
after all other treatments have failed.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of
approaches. Meditationand mindfulness training are
thought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-
der. Hydrotherapyis useful to some anxious patients
because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-
tem. Yoga, aikido,t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patients
work with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensions
that either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.
Homeopathyand traditional Chinese medicine
approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.
Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on
other associated symptoms and the patient’s general con-
stitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage
of qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most
likely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow.
The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc-
turepoint locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi
and rebalance the entire system in relation to the lung
and large intestine.
Aromatherapyusing essential oils can also be ben-
eficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils go
directly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-
trols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-
vous system.
Prognosis
The prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends on
the specific disorder and a wide variety of factors,
including the patient’s age, sex, general health, living sit-
uation, belief system, social support network, and
responses to different anxiolytic medications and forms
of therapy.
Prevention
Humans have significant control over thoughts, and,
therefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety by
changing irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans also have
some power over anxiety arising from social and envi-
ronmental conditions. Other forms of anxiety, however,
are built into the human organism and its life cycle, and
cannot be prevented or eliminated.

KEY TERMS
Affect—An observed emotional expression or
response. In some situations, anxiety would be
considered an inappropriate affect.
Anxiolytic—A type of medication that helps to
relieve anxiety.
Autonomic nervous system (ANS)—The part of
the nervous system that supplies nerve endings in
the blood vessels, heart, intestines, glands, and
smooth muscles, and governs their involuntary
functioning. The autonomic nervous system is
responsible for the biochemical changes involved
in experiences of anxiety.
Endocrine gland—A ductless gland, such as the
pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal gland, that secretes its
products directly into the blood or lymph.
Free-floating anxiety—Anxiety that lacks a defi-
nite focus or content.
Hyperarousal—A state or condition of muscular
and emotional tension produced by hormones
released during the fight-or-flight reaction.
Hypothalamus—A portion of the brain that regu-
lates the autonomic nervous system, the release of
hormones from the pituitary gland, sleep cycles,
and body temperature.
Limbic system—A group of structures in the brain
that includes the hypothalamus, amygdala, and
hippocampus. The limbic system plays an impor-
tant part in regulation of human moods and emo-
tions. Many psychiatric disorders are related to
malfunctioning of the limbic system.
Phobia—In psychoanalytic theory, a psychologi-
cal defense against anxiety in which the patient
displaces anxious feelings onto an external object,
activity, or situation.
Anxiety disorders
Definition
The anxietydisorders are a group of mental distur-
bances characterized by anxiety as a central or core symp-
tom. Although anxiety is a commonplace experience, not
everyone who experiences it has an anxiety disorder. Anx-
iety is associated with a wide range of physical illnesses,
medication side effects, and other psychiatric disorders.
The revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders (DSM)that took place after
1980 brought major changes in the classification of the
anxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists classified
patients on the basis of a theory of causality that defined
anxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in the
patient’s mind. DSM-III(1980),DSM-III-R(1987), and
DSM-IV(1994) introduced and refined a new classifica-
tion that took into consideration recent discoveries about
the biochemical and post-traumatic origins of some types
of anxiety. The present definitions are based on the exter-
nal and reported symptom patterns of the disorders rather
than on theories about their origins.
Description
Anxiety disorders are the most common form of
mental disturbance in the United States population. It is
estimated that 28 million persons suffer from an anxiety
disorder every year. These disorders are a serious prob-
lem for the entire society because of their interference
with patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They also
contribute to the high rates of alcohol and substance
abuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders are an addi-
tional problem for health professionals because the phys-
ical symptoms of anxiety frequently bring people to pri-
mary care doctors or emergency rooms.
DSM-IVdefines twelve types of anxiety disorders in
the adult population. They can be grouped under seven
headings:
• Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia. The
chief characteristic of panic disorderis the occurrence
of panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrence.
In clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disor-
der by itself, but is typically associated with some form
of panic disorder. Patients with agoraphobia are afraid
of places or situations in which they might have a panic
attack and be unable to leave or to find help. About
25% of patients with panic disorder develop obsessive-
compulsive disorder(OCD).
•Phobias. These include specific phobias and social
phobia. A phobia is an intense irrational fear of a spe-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2322
Anxiety disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 322  cific object or situation that compels the patient to
avoid it. Some phobias concern activities or objects that
involve some risk (for example, flying or driving) but
many are focused on harmless animals or other objects.
Social phobia involves a fear of being humiliated,
judged, or scrutinized. It manifests itself as a fear of
performing certain functions in the presence of others,
such as public speaking or using public lavatories.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is
marked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent thoughts or
repetitive behaviors that reflect the patient’s anxiety or
attempts to control it. It affects between 2-3% of the
population and is much more common than was previ-
ously thought.
•Stressdisorders. These include post-traumatic stress
disorder(PTSD) and acute stress disorder. Stress dis-
orders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic events in
the patient’s life.
•Generalized anxiety disorder(GAD). GAD is the
most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and occurs
most frequently in young adults.
• Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes. These
include general medical conditions or substance abuse.
• Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last cate-
gory is not a separate type of disorder, but is included to
cover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSM-IV
criteria for other anxiety disorders.
All DSM-IVanxiety disorder diagnoses include a
criterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe enough
to interfere significantly with the patient’s occupational
or educational functioning, social activities or close rela-
tionships, and other customary activities.
The anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency
of occurrence in the general population, age of onset,
family patterns, and gender distribution. The stress disor-
ders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditions
or substance abuse are less age- and gender-specific.
Whereas OCD affects males and females equally, GAD,
panic disorder, and specific phobias all affect women
more frequently than men. GAD and panic disorders are
more likely to develop in young adults, while phobias
and OCD can begin in childhood.
Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents
DSM-IVdefines one anxiety disorder as specific to
children, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This disor-
der is defined as anxiety regarding separation from home
or family that is excessive or inappropriate for the child’s
age. In some children, separation anxiety takes the form
of school avoidance.
Children and adolescents can also be diagnosed with
panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder,
and the post- traumatic stress syndromes.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of anxiety include a variety of individual
and general social factors, and may produce physical,
cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms. The
patient’s ethnic or cultural background may also influ-
ence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxiety.
Genetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalities
may also play a role.
Anxiety in children may be caused by suffering from
abuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by
the variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disor-
ders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Many
patients who suffer from anxiety disorders have features
or symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whose
anxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder,
such as schizophreniaor major depression, are not diag-
nosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining an
anxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseases
that are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to take
the patient’s medication history, in order to exclude side
effects of prescription drugs. Most doctors will ask about
caffeineconsumption to see if the patient’s dietary habits
are a factor. The patient’s work and family situation will
also be discussed. Laboratory tests for blood sugar and
thyroid function are also common
Diagnostic testing for anxiety
There are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi-
ety, although the doctor may order some specific tests to
rule out disease conditions. Although there is no psychi-
atric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety dis-
orders, there are several short-answer interviews or symp-
tom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the inten-
sity of a patient’s anxiety and some of its associated fea-
tures. These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale
and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).
Treatment
For relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapy
alone may suffice. In general, doctors prefer to use a com-
bination of medications and psychotherapy with more
severely anxious patients. Most patients respond better to
a combination of treatment methods than to either med-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	323
Anxiety disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 323  ications or psychotherapy in isolation. Because of the
variety of medications and treatment approaches that are
used to treat anxiety disorders, the doctor cannot predict
in advance which combination will be most helpful to a
specific patient. In many cases the doctor will need to try
a new medication or treatment over a six- to eight-week
period in order to assess its effectiveness. Treatment trials
do not necessarily mean that the patient cannot be helped
or that the doctor is incompetent.
Although anxiety disorders are not always easy to
diagnose, there are several reasons why it is important for
patients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help. Anxi-
ety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often progresses to
panic attacks, phobias, and episodes of depression.
Untreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diag-
nosis of major depression, or interfere with the patient’s
education or ability to keep a job. In addition, many anx-
ious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol when
they try to “medicate” their symptoms. Moreover, since
children learn ways of coping with anxiety from their par-
ents, adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a bet-
ter position to help their families cope with factors that
lead to anxiety than those who remain untreated.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of
approaches. Meditationand mindfulness training are
thought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-
der. Hydrotherapyis useful to some anxious patients
because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-
tem. Yoga, aikido,t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patients
work with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensions
that either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.
Homeopathyand traditional Chinese medicine
approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.
Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on other
associated symptoms and the patient’s general constitution.
Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qi,or
vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most likely to
affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow. The practi-
tioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupuncturepoint
locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalance
the entire system in relation to the lung and large intestine.
Aromatherapyusing essential oils can also be ben-
eficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils go
directly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-

appear to be beneficial in helping people lower their

Aortic aneurysm
Definition
An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or swelling of
a portion of a blood vessel. The aorta, which can develop
these abnormal bulges, is the large blood vessel that car-
ries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of
the body.
Description
The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and
is therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an
artery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner
layer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel its
flexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and a
fiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not
burst when the heart pumps blood to the body.
Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops
in part of the wall of the aorta; three basic types are usual-
ly found. If all three layers of the vessel are affected and
weakness develops along an extended area of the vessel,
the weakened area will appear as a large, bulging region
of blood vessel; this is called a fusiform aneurysm. If
weakness develops between the inner and outer layers of	the aortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the interior	of the vessel is pushed around the damaged region in the	wall and collects between these layers. This is called a	dissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” or	separated from another. If damage occurs to only the mid-	dle (muscular) layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge can	form; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm.
Causes and symptoms
Aortic aneurysms occur in different portions of the
aorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and travels
downward through the abdomen. Aneurysms found in
the region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracic
aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that occur in the part of the
aorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aortic
aneurysms.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce
any noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysm
becomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, or
abdominal paincan result. Abdominal aortic aneurysms
occur more often in men, and these aneurysms can cause
pain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful
abdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that the
aneurysm could burst very soon.
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by
atherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostly
cholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner
wall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the
aortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak and
often results in an aneurysm or bulge.
Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of
the muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by high
blood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and although
rare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 325  Diagnosis
Silent, stable aneurysms are often detected when a
person has an x ray as part of a routine examination or
for other medical reasons. Otherwise, when chest,
abdominal, or back pain is severe, aortic aneurysm is
suspected and x-ray (radiographic) studies can confirm
or rule out that condition.
Treatment
Aortic aneurysms are potentially life-threatening con-
ditions. Small aneurysms should be monitored for their rate
of growth and large aneurysms require consideration for a
surgical repair. The most common method of surgical
repair is to cut out the bulging section of artery wall and
sew a Dacron fiber material into its place in the vessel wall.
Prognosis
Only 1-2% of people die from having surgical repair
of an aortic aneurysm. However, if the aneurysm is
untreated and eventually ruptures, less than half of the
people with ruptured aneurysms will survive. The chal-
lenge for the physician is to decide when or if to do the
preventive surgery.
Prevention
Aneuryms can develop in people with atherosclerosis.
High blood pressure can also lead to this condition. Although
no definite prevention exists, lifestyle and dietary changes
that help lower blood pressure and the amount of fat in the
blood stream may slow the development of aneurysms.

Aortic dissection
Definition
Aortic dissection is a rare, but potentially fatal, con-
dition in which blood passes through the inner lining and
between the layers of the aorta. The dissecting aorta usu-
ally does not burst, but has an abnormal second channel
within it.
Description
A defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an
opening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main artery of
the body and is an area of high blood pressure. When a
defect develops, blood pressure can force the tear to open
and allow blood to pass through. Since the blood is under
pressure, it eventually splits (dissecting) the middle layer
of the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood.
The length of the channel grows over time and can result
in the closing off of connection points to other arteries.
This can lead to heart attack, strokes, abdominal pain,
and nerve damage. Blood may leak from the dissection
and collect in the chest an around the heart.
A second mechanism leading to aortic dissection is
medial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in the
middle layer of the blood vessel and spills through the
inner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then allows
blood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin a
dissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of aortic dissec-
tion occur yearly in the United States.
Causes and symptoms
Aortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of the
inner lining of the aorta. There are a number of condi-
tions that predispose a person to develop defects of the
inner lining, including high blood pressure, Marfan’s dis-
ease,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective tissue dis-
eases, and defects of heart development which begin dur-
ing fetal development. A dissection can also occur acci-
dentally following insertion of a catheter, trauma, or
surgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. The
pain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient and
cause him to fall to the ground. The pain is frequently
felt in both the chest and in the back, between the shoul-
der blades. The extent of the pain is proportional to the
length of the dissection.
Diagnosis
The pain experienced by the patient is the first symp-
tom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is usually
described by the patient as “tearing, ripping, or stabbing.”
This is in contrast to the pain associated with heart
attacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or absent
pulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard if the
dissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta will usu-
ally appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams of
most patients. The use of a blood dye in angiograms
and/or CT scans (computed tomography scans) will aid
in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.
Treatment
Because of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis-
section, patients are treated immediately. Drugs are
administered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate.
If the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may be
used. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery,
damaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthet-
ic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel.
Prognosis
Depending on the nature and extent of the dissection,
deathcan occur within a few hours of the start of a dis-
section. Approximately 75% of untreated people die with-

treated, 40% survive more than 10 years. Patients are usu-
ally given long term treatment with drugs to reduce their
blood pressure, even if they have had surgery.

Aortic valve insufficiency
Definition
The aortic valve separates the left ventricle of the
heart (the heart’s largest pumping chamber) from the
aorta, the large artery that carries oxygen-rich blood out
of the left ventricle to the rest of the body. In aortic valve
insufficiency, the aortic valve becomes leaky, causing
blood to flow backwards into the left ventricle.
Description
Aortic valve insufficiency occurs when this valve
cannot properly close after blood that is leaving the
heart’s left ventricle enters the aorta. With each contrac-
tion of the heart more and more blood flows back into the

left ventricle, causing the ventricle to become overfilled.
This larger-than-normal amount of blood that collects in
the left ventricle puts pressure on the walls of the heart,
causing the heart muscle to increase in thickness (hyper-
trophy). If this thickening continues, the heart can be per-
manently damaged.
Aortic valve insufficiency is also know as aortic
valve regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flow
of blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve.
Causes and symptoms
The faulty working of the aortic valve can be caused
by a birth defect; by abnormal widening of the aorta (which
can be caused by very high blood pressure and a variety of
other less common conditions); by various diseases that
cause large amounts of swelling (inflammation) in different
areas of the body, like rheumatic fever; and, although
rarely, by the sexually transmitted disease,syphilis.
About 75% of people with aortic valve insufficiency
are men. Rheumatic (inflammatory) diseases have been
the main cause of this condition in both men and women.
Aortic valve insufficiency can remain unnoticed for
10 to 15 years. In cases of severe insufficiency a person
may notice a variety of symptoms, including an uncom-
fortable pounding of the heart when lying down, a very
rapid or hard heart beat (palpitations),shortness of
breath, chest pain, and if untreated for very long times,
swelling of the liver, ankles, and belly.
Diagnosis
A poorly functioning or insufficient aortic valve can
be identified when a doctor listens to the heart during a
physical examination. A chest x ray, an electrocardio-
gram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heart beats), as
well as an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves
to create an image of the heart and its valves), can further
evaluate or confirm the condition.
Treatment
Aortic insufficiency is usually corrected by having
the defective valve surgically replaced. However, such an
operation is done in severe cases. Before the condition
worsens, certain drugs can be used to help manage this
condition.
Drugs that remove water from the body, drugs that
lower blood pressure, and drugs that help the heart beat
more effectively can each be used for this condition.
Reducing the amount of salt in the diet also helps lower
the amount of fluid the body holds and can help the heart
to work more efficiently as well.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 328  In cases of a severely malfunctioning valve that has
been untreated for a long time, surgery is the treatment of
choice, especially if the heart is not functioning normal-
ly. Human heart valves can be replaced with man-made
valves or with valves taken from pig hearts.
Prognosis
Although drug treatment can help put off the need
for surgical valve replacement, it is important to replace
the faulty valve before the heart muscle itself is damaged
beyond recovery.

Aortic valve stenosis
Definition
When aortic valve stenosis occurs, the aortic valve,
located between the aorta and left ventricle of the heart,
is narrower than normal size.
Description
A normal aortic valve, when open, allows the free
flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta.
When the valve narrows, as it does with stenosis,
blood flow is impeded. Because it is more difficult for
blood to flow through the valve, there is increased
strain on the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to
enlarge and malfunction, resulting in reduced blood
supply to the heart muscle and body, as well as fluid
build up in the lungs.
Cause and symptoms
Aortic valve stenosis can occur because of a birth
defect in the formation of the valve. Calcium deposits
may form on the valve with aging, causing the valve to
become stiff and narrow. Stenosis can also occur as a
result of rheumatic fever. Mild aortic stenosis may pro-
duce no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms,
depending on the severity of the disease, are chest pain,
blackouts, and difficulty breathing.

Using a stethoscope, a physician may hear a murmur
and other abnormal heart sounds. An ECG, also called an
electrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of the
heart. This technique and chest x raycan show evidence
that the left ventricle is enlarged. An x ray can also reveal
calcium deposits on the valve, as well as congestion in
the lungs. Echocardiographycan pick up thickening of
the valve, heart size, and whether or not the valve is
working properly. This is a procedure in which high fre-
quency sound waves harmlessly bounce off organs in the
body. Cardiac catheterization, in which a contrast dye
is injected in an artery using a catheter, is the key tool to
confirm stenosis and gauge its severity.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the symptoms and how the
heart’s function is affected. The valve can be opened with-
out surgery by using a balloon catheter, but this is often a
temporary solution. The procedure involves inserting a
deflated balloon at the end of a catheter through the arteries
to the valve. Inflating the balloon should widen the valve. In
severe stenosis,heart valve replacementis recommended,
most often involving open-heart surgery. The valve can be
replaced with a mechanical valve, a valve from a pig, or by
moving the patient’s other heart valve (pulmonary) into the
position of the aortic valve and then replacing the pul-
monary valve with an mechanical one. Anyone with aortic
stenosis needs to take antibiotics(amoxicillin, ery-
thromycin, or clindamycin) before dental and some other
surgical procedures, to prevent a heart valve infection.
Prognosis
The prognosis for aortic valve stenosis depends on
the severity of the disease. With surgical repair, the dis-

ally lead a normal life; a minority of the patients progress
to severe disease. Anyone with moderate stenosis should
avoid vigorous physical activity. Most of these patients
end up suffering some kind of coronary heart disease
over a 10 year period. Because it is a progressive disease,
moderate and severe stenosis will be treated ultimately
with surgery. Severe disease, if left untreated, leads to
deathwithin 2 to 4 years once the symptoms start.
Prevention
There is no way to prevent aortic stenosis.

Apgar testing
Definition
Apgar testing is the assessment of the newborn rat-
ing color, heart rate, stimulus response, muscle tone, and
respirations on a scale of zero to two, for a maximum
possible score of 10. It is performed twice, first at one
minute and then again at five minutes after birth.
Purpose
Apgar scoring was originally developed in the 1950s
by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist practi-
tioners attending a birth in deciding whether or not a
newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a scoring
method fosters consistency and standardization among
different practitioners. A February 2001 study published
in the New England Journal of Medicineinvestigated
whether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant.
Researchers concluded that “The Apgar scoring system
remains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal sur-
vival today as it was almost 50 years ago”.
Description
The five areas are scored as follows:
• Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1 for
acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink, but
the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole body is
blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin color will
not be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, espe-
cially in the soles and palms. Color is related to the
neonate’s ability to oxygenate its body and extremities,
and is dependent on heart rate and respirations. A per-
fectly healthy newborn will often receive a score of 9
because of some blueness in the hands and feet.
• Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per minute
(bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no pulse.
Heart rate is assessed by listening with a stethoscope to
the newborn’s heart and counting the number of beats.
• Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate coughs,
sneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a stimulus
KEY TERMS
Acrocyanosis—A slight cyanosis, or blueness of
the hands and feet of the neonate is considered
normal. This impaired ability to fully oxygenate
the extremities is due to an immature circulatory
system which is still in flux.
Amniotic fluid—The protective bag of fluid that
surrounds the fetus while growing in the uterus.
Neonate—A term referring to the newborn infant,
from birth until one month of age.
Neonatologist—A physician who specializes in
problems of newborn infants.
Pallor—Extreme paleness in the color of the skin.
(such as the use of nasal suctioning, stroking the back
to assess for spinal abnormalities, or having the foot
tapped); 1 for a slight cry or grimace in response to the
stimulus; 0 for no response.
• Activity, or muscle tone: 2 for vigorous movements of
arms and legs; 1 for some movement; 0 for no move-
ment, limpness.
• Respirations: 2 for visible breathing and crying; 1 for
slow, weak, irregular breathing; 0 for apnea, or no
breathing. A crying newborn can adequately oxygenate
its lungs. Respirations are best assessed by watching
the rise and fall of the neonate’s abdomen, as infants are
diaphragmatic breathers.
The combined first letters in these five areas spell
Apgar.
Preparation
No preparation is needed to perform the test. How-
ever, while being born the neonate may receive nasal and
oral suctioning to remove mucus and amniotic fluid. This
may be done when the head of the newborn is safely out,
while the mother rests before she continues to push.
Aftercare
Since the test is primarily observational in nature, no
aftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the need
for immediate intervention or prolonged observation.
Normal results
The maximum possible score is 10, the minimum is
zero. It is rare to receive a true 10, as some acrocyanosis in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	331
Apgar testing
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 331  the newborn is considered normal, and therefore not a
cause for concern. Most infants score between 7 and 10.
These infants are expected to have an excellent outcome.
A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires immediate intervention, usu-
ally in the form of oxygen and respiratory assistance, or
perhaps just suctioning if breathing has been obstructed by
mucus. While suctioning is being done, a source of oxy-
gen may be placed near, but not over the newborn’s nose
and mouth. This form of oxygen is referred to as blow-by.
A score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is hav-
ing some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life. This may
be due to medications given to the mother during a diffi-
cult labor, or at the very end of labor, when these medica-
tions have an exaggerated effect on the neonate.
Abnormal results
With a score of 0-3, the newborn is unresponsive,
apneic, pale, limp and may not have a pulse. Interven-
tions to resuscitate will begin immediately. The test is
repeated at five minutes after birth and both scores are
documented. Should the resuscitation effort continue into
the five-minute time period, interventions will not stop in
order to perform the test. The one-minute score indicates
DR. VIRGINIA APGAR (1909–1974)
the need for intervention at birth. It addresses survival	and prevention of birth-related complications resulting	from inadequate oxygen supply. Poor oxygenation may	be due to inadequate neurological and/or chemical con-	trol of respiration. The five-minute score appears to have	a more predictive value for morbidity and normal devel-	opment, although research studies on this are inconsis-	tent in their conclusions.

Apgar testing
As one of very few female medical students at
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons
in New York during the early 1930s and one of the first
women to graduate from its medical school, Apgar knew
that her goal of becoming a surgeon would not be
achieved easily in a male-dominated profession. Reluc-
tantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiol-
ogy, she embraced her new field with typical intelligence
and energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a relatively
new field, having been left by the doctors mostly to the
attention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately how
much in need of scientifically trained personnel was this
significant part of surgery, and she set out to make anes-
thesiology a separate medical discipline. By 1937, she
had become the fiftieth physician to be certified as an
anesthesiologist in the United States. The following year
she was appointed director of anesthesiology at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming the
first woman to head a department at that institution.
As the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in the
delivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgar
realized that infants had died from respiratory or circulato-
ry complications that early treatment could have prevent-
ed. Apgar decided to bring her considerable research skills
to this childbirth dilemma, and her careful study resulted
in her publication of the Apgar Score System in 1952.

Aphasia
Definition
Aphasia is condition characterized by either partial
or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally or
using written words. A person with aphasia may have
difficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing the
names of objects, or understanding what other people
have said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as may
occur during a traumatic accident or when the brain is
deprived of oxygen during a stroke. It may also be
caused by a brain tumor, a disease such as Alzheimer’s,
or an infection, like encephalitis. Aphasia may be tem-
porary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speech
impediments caused by loss of muscle control.
Description
To understand and use language effectively, an indi-
vidual draws upon word memory—stored information on
what certain words mean, how to put them together, and
how and when to use them properly. For a majority of
people, these and other language functions are located in
the left side (hemisphere) of the brain. Damage to this
side of the brain is most commonly linked to the devel-
opment of aphasia. Interestingly, however, left-handed
people appear to have language areas in both the left and
right hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, may
develop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain.
Stroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the
United States. Approximately 500,000 individuals suffer
strokes each year, and 20% of these individuals develop
some type of aphasia. Other causes of brain damage
include head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. About
half of the people who show signs of aphasia have what
is called temporary or transient aphasia and recover com-
pletely within a few days. An estimated one million
Americans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia.
As yet, no connection between aphasia and age, gender,
or race has been found.
Aphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions
that affect speech, such as dysarthria and apraxia. These
condition affect the muscles used in speaking rather than
language function itself. Dysarthria is a speech distur-
bance caused by lack of control over the muscles used in
speaking, perhaps due to nerve damage. Speech apraxia is
a speech disturbance in which language comprehension
and muscle control are retained, but the memory of how
to use the muscles to form words is not.
Causes and symptoms
Aphasia can develop after an individual sustains a
brain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or infec-
tion, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of this injury,
the pathways for language comprehension or production
are disrupted or destroyed. For most people, this means
damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99%
of right-handed people, language centers are in the left
hemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people also
have left-hemisphere language dominance.) According to
the traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasia
is caused by damage to a different part of the left hemi-
sphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of the
basic language functions: speech, naming (the ability to
identify an object, color, or other item with an appropriate
word or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words,
phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the abili-
ty to understand spoken language), reading (the ability to
understand written words and their meaning), and writing
(the ability to communicate and record events with text).
The traditional classification scheme includes eight
types of aphasia:
• Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results from
damage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the lan-
guage-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with
Broca’s aphasia may be completely unable to use speech
(mutism) or may be able to use single-word statements
or even full sentences, though these sentences may
require a great deal of effort to construct. Small words,
such as conjunctions (and, or, but) and articles (the, an,
a), may be omitted, leading to a “telegraph” quality in
their speech. Hearing comprehension is usually not
affected, so they are able to understand other people’s
speech and conversation and can follow commands.
Often, they may experience weakness on the right side of
their bodies, which can make it difficult to write. Read-
ing ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty find-
ing the right word when speaking. Individuals with
Broca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressed
because they are aware of their language difficulties.
• Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the side
portion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant area
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	333
Aphasia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 333  of the brain. Individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia speak
in long, uninterrupted sentences; however, the words
used are frequently unnecessary or even made-up. They
have a great deal of difficulty understanding other peo-
ple’s speech, sometimes to the point of being unable to
understand spoken language at all. Reading ability is
diminished, and although writing ability is retained,
what is written may be abnormal. No physical symp-
toms, such as the right-sided weakness seen with
Broca’s aphasia, are typically observed. Also, in con-
trast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’s
aphasia are not aware of their language errors.
• Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to the
language areas of the left hemisphere. As a result, all
basic language functions are affected, but some areas
may be more affected than others. For example, an indi-
vidual may have difficulty speaking but may be able to
write well. The individual may experience weakness
and loss of feeling on the right side of their body.
• Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is
rather uncommon. Individuals with conduction aphasia
are unable to repeat words, sentences, and phrases.
Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may
frequently correct themselves and words may be
skipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo-
ken language, it may also be difficult for the individual
with conduction aphasia to find the right word to
describe a person or object. The impact of this condi-
tion on reading and writing ability varies. As with other
types of aphasia, right-sided weakness or sensory loss
may be present.
• Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an
individual’s ability to find the right name for a person
or object. As a result, an object may be described rather
than named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, read-
ing, and writing are not affected, other than by this
inability to find the right name. Speech is fluent, except
for pauses as the individual tries to recall the right
name. Physical symptoms are variable, and some indi-
viduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness or
sensory loss.
• Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan-
guage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primary
language areas. There are three types of aphasia:
transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory apha-
sia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. All of the transcor-
tical aphasias are distinguished from other types by the
individual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen-
tences. Other language functions may also be impaired
to varying degrees, depending on the extent and partic-
ular location of brain damage.
As researchers continue to learn more about the
brain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia are
being recognized. One newly recognized type of aphasia,
subcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms of other tradi-
tional types of aphasia but involves language disorders
that are not typical. This type of aphasia is associated
with injuries to areas of the brain typically not identified
with language and language processing.
Diagnosis
Following brain injury, an initial bedside assessment is
made to determine whether language function has been
affected. If the individual experiences difficulty communi-
cating, attempts are made to determine whether this diffi-
culty arises from impaired language comprehension or an
impaired ability to speak. A typical examination involves
listening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individ-
ual’s ability to recognize and name objects, comprehend
what is heard, and repeat sample words and phrases. The
individual may also be asked to read text aloud and explain
what the passage means. In addition, writing ability is eval-
uated by having the individual copy text, transcribe dictated
text, and write something without prompting.

Aphasia
Broca's area
Wernicke's area
Broca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of
the language-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with
Broca’s aphasia may become mute or may be able to use
single-word statements or full sentences, although it may
require great effort. Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage
to the temporal lobe of the language-dominant area of the
brain. People with this condition speak in long, uninterrupt-
ed sentences, but the words used are often unnecessary and
unintelligible.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 334  A speech pathologist or neuropsychologist may be
asked to conduct more extensive examinations using in-
depth, standardized tests. Commonly used tests include the
Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, the Western Apha-
sia Battery, and possibly, the Porch Index of Speech Ability.
The results of these tests indicate the severity of the
aphasia and may also provide information regarding the
exact location of the brain damage. This more extensive
testing is also designed to provide the information neces-
sary to design an individualized speech therapy program.
Further information about the location of the damage is
gained through the use of imaging technology, such as
magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computed
tomography scans(CT).

Initially, the underlying cause of aphasia must be
treated or stabilized. To regain language function, thera-
KEY TERMS
Anomic aphasia—A condition characterized by
either partial or total loss of the ability to recall the
names of persons or things as a result of a stroke,
head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Broca’s aphasia—A condition characterized by either
partial or total loss of the ability to express oneself,
either through speech or writing. Hearing compre-
hension is not affected. This condition may result
from a stroke, head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Computed tomography (CT)—An imaging tech-
nique that uses cross-sectional x rays of the body to
create a three-dimensional image of the body’s
internal structures.
Conduction aphasia—A condition characterized by
the inability to repeat words, sentences, or phrases
as a result of a stroke, head injury, brain tumor, or
infection.
Frontal lobe—The largest, most forward-facing part
of each side or hemisphere of the brain.
Global aphasia—A condition characterized by
either partial or total loss of the ability to communi-
cate verbally or using written words as a result of
widespread injury to the language areas of the
brain. This condition may be caused by a stroke,
head injury, brain tumor, or infection. The exact lan-
guage abilities affected vary depending on the loca-
tion and extent of injury.
Hemisphere—One of the two halves or sides-the
left and the right-of the brain.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An imaging
technique that uses a large circular magnet and
radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the
body. These signals are used to construct images of
internal structures.
Subcortical aphasia—A condition characterized by
either partial or total loss of the ability to communi-
cate verbally or using written words as a result of
damage to non language-dominated areas of the
brain. This condition may be caused by a stroke,
head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Temporal lobe—The part of each side or hemi-
sphere of the brain that is on the side of the head,
nearest the ears.
Transcortical aphasia—A condition characterized
by either partial or total loss of the ability to com-
municate verbally or using written words that does
not affect an individual’s ability to repeat words,
phrases, and sentences.

either partial or total loss of the ability to under-
stand what is being said or read. The individual
maintains the ability to speak, but speech may con-
tain unnecessary or made-up words.
py must begin as soon as possible following the injury.
Although there are no medical or surgical procedures
currently available to treat this condition, aphasia result-
ing from stroke or head injurymay improve through the
use of speech therapy. For most individuals, however, the
primary emphasis is placed on making the most of
retained language abilities and learning to use other
means of communication to compensate for lost lan-
guage abilities.
Speech therapy is tailored to meet individual needs,
but activities and tools that are frequently used include
the following:
•Exerciseand practice. Weakened muscles are exercised
by repetitively speaking certain words or making facial
expressions, such as smiling.
• Picture cards. Pictures of everyday objects are used to
improve word recall and increase vocabulary. The

aloud as part of an exercise and practice routine.
• Picture boards. Pictures of everyday objects and activi-
ties are placed together, and the individual points to
certain pictures to convey ideas and communicate with
others.
• Workbooks. Reading and writing exercises are used to
sharpen word recall and regain reading and writing
abilities. Hearing comprehension is also redeveloped
using these exercises.
• Computers. Computer software can be used to improve
speech, reading, recall, and hearing comprehension by,
for example, displaying pictures and having the indi-
vidual find the right word.
Prognosis
The degree to which an individual can recover lan-
guage abilities is highly dependent on how much brain
damage occurred and the location and cause of the origi-
nal brain injury. Other factors include the individual’s
age, general health, motivation and willingness to partici-
pate in speech therapy, and whether the individual is left
or right handed. Language areas may be located in both
the left and right hemispheres in left-handed individuals.
Left-handed individuals are, therefore, more likely to
develop aphasia following brain injury, but because they
have two language centers, may recover more fully
because language abilities can be recovered from either
side of the brain. The intensity of therapy and the time
between diagnosis and the start of therapy may also
affect the eventual outcome.
Prevention
Because there is no way of knowing when a stroke,
traumatic head injury, or disease will occur, very little
can be done to prevent aphasia. The extent of recovery,
however, in some cases, can be affected by an individ-
ual’s willingness to cooperate and participate in speech
therapy directly following the injury.

Aplastic anemia
Definition
Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone mar-
row greatly decreases or stops production of blood cells.
Description
The bone marrow (soft tissue which is located with-
in the hard outer shell of the bones) is responsible for the
production of all the types of blood cells. The mature
forms of these cells include red blood cells, which carry
oxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, which
fight infection; and platelets, which are involved in clot-
ting. In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrow
becomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for gener-
ating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatly
decreased in number or absent. These hematopoietic
cells are replaced by large quantities of fat.
Yearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people in
every one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes both
males and females of all ages, there are two age groups
that have an increased risk. Both young adults (between
15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the age of 60)
have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the general
population. While the disorder occurs worldwide, young
adults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do popula-
tions in North America and Europe.
Causes and symptoms
Aplastic anemia falls into three basic categories,
based on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired, and
hereditary.
In about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is considered
to be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the disorder is
unknown.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2336
Aplastic anemia
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 336  Acquired aplastic anemia refers to those cases where
certain environmental factors and physical conditions
seem to be associated with development of the disease.
Acquired aplastic anemia can be associated with:
• exposure to drugs, especially anti-cancer agents,antibi-
otics, anti-inflammatory agents, seizure medications,
and antithyroid drugs (drugs given to stop the function-
ing of an overactive thyroid)
• exposure to radiation
• chemical exposure (especially to the organic solvent
benzene and certain insecticides)
• infection with certain viruses (especially those causing
viral hepatitis, as well as Epstein-Barr virus, par-
vovirus, and HIV, the virus which can cause AIDS)
• pregnancy
• certain other disorders, including a disease called parox-
ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an autoimmune reac-
tion called graft-vs-host disease (which occurs when the
body’s immune system attacks and destroys the body’s
own cells), and certain connective tissue diseases
Hereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare, but
does occur in Fanconi’s anemia, Shwachman-Diamond
syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita.
Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those of
other anemias, including fatigue, weakness, tiny red-
dish-purple marks (petechiae) on the skin (evidence of
pinpoint hemorrhages into the skin), evidence of abnor-
mal bruising, and bleeding from the gums, nose, intes-
tine, or vagina. The patient is likely to appear pale. If the
anemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in the
blood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sud-
den appearance of a new heart murmur.
Diagnosis
The blood countin aplastic anemia will reveal low
numbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells will
appear normal in size and coloration, but greatly
decreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (very
young red blood cells, which are usually produced in
great numbers by the bone marrow in order to compen-
sate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number.
Platelets and white blood cells will also be decreased in
number, though normal in structure.
A sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need to
be removed by needle (usually from the hip bone) and
examined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia is pre-
sent, this examination will reveal very few or no
hematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat.
Treatment
The first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia
involves discontinuing exposure to any substance that
may be causing the disorder. Although it would seem that
blood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, in
fact, they only serve as a temporary help, and may com-
plicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation.
The most successful treatment for aplastic anemia is
bone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow donor
(often a sibling) must be identified. There are a number of
tissue markers which must be examined to determine
whether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatible
with the patient’s immune system. Compatibility is neces-
sary to avoid complications, including the destruction of
the donor marrow by the patient’s own immune system.
Patients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans-
plant can be treated with a number of agents, including
antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide,
steroids, and cyclosporine. These agents all have the
potential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects.
Furthermore, not all patients respond fully to these
agents. Still, even among those patients who do have a
good response, many later suffer a relapse (return) of
aplastic anemia.
Prognosis
Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness. Without
treatment, it will almost surely progress to death. Sur-
vival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosis,
which type of treatment a patient is eligible for, and what
kind of response their body has to that treatment. The
worst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associated
with very low numbers of a particular type of white
blood cell. These patients have a high chance of dying
from overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 80% of
all patients treated with blood transfusions alone die
within 18 months to two years. Patients who undergo
bone marrow transplantation have a 60-90% chance of
being cured of the disease.

Appendectomy
Definition
Appendectomy is the surgical removal of the appen-
dix. The appendix is a worm-shaped hollow pouch
attached to the cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.
Purpose
Appendectomies are performed to treat appendici-
tis, an inflamed and infected appendix.
Precautions
Since appendicitis occurs most commonly in males
between the ages of 10-14 and in females between the ages
KEY TERMS

of 15-19, appendectomy is most often performed during this
time. The diagnosis of appendicitis is most difficult in the
very young (less than two years of age) and in the elderly.
Description
Appendectomy is considered a major surgical opera-
tion. Therefore, a general surgeon must perform this
operation in the operating room of a hospital. An anes-
thesiologist is also present during the operation to admin-
ister an anesthetic. Most often the anesthesiologist uses a
general anesthetic technique whereby patients are put to
sleep and made painfree by administering drugs in the
vein or by agents inhaled through a tube placed in the
windpipe. Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used.
After the patient is anesthetized, the general surgeon
can remove the appendix either by using the traditional
open procedure (in which a 2-3 [5-7.6 cm] in incision is
made in the abdomen) or via laparoscopy(in which four
1 in [2.5 cm] incisions are made in the abdomen).
Traditional open appendectomy
When the surgeon uses the open approach, he makes
an incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Most
incisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeon
then identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and exam-
ines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendix
is located and brought up into the wounds. The surgeon
separates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue and
its attachment to the cecum and then removes it. The site
where the appendix was previously attached, the cecum, is
closed and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layers
and then the skin are sewn together.
Laproscopic appendectomy
When the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec-
tomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length,
are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or navel,
and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Two
other incisions are smaller and are in the right side of the
lower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a camera and
special instruments through these incisions. With the aid
of this equipment, the surgeon visually examines the
abdominal organs and identifies the appendix. Similarly,
the appendix is freed from all of its attachments and
removed. The place where the appendix was formerly
attached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix is
removed through one of the incisions. The instruments
are removed and then all of the incisions are closed.
Studies and opinions about the relative advantages
and disadvantages of each method are divided. A skilled
surgeon can perform either one of these procedures in

Appendectomy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 338  less than one hour. However, laproscopic appendectomy
(LA) always takes longer than traditional appendectomy
(TA). The increased time required to do a LA increases
the patient’s exposure to anesthetics, which increases the
risk of complications. The increased time requirement
also escalates fees charged by the hospital for operating
room time and by the anesthesiologist. Since LA also
requires specialized equipment, the fees for its use also
increases the hospital charges. Patients with either opera-
tion have similar pain medication needs, begin eating
dietsat comparable times, and stay in the hospital equiv-
alent amounts of time. LA is of special benefit in women
in whom the diagnosis is difficult and gynecological dis-
ease (such as endometriosis,pelvic inflammatory dis-
ease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts,
and tubal pregnancies) may be the source of pain and not
appendicitis. If LA is done in these patients, the pelvic
organs can be more thoroughly examined and a definitive
diagnosis made prior to removal of the appendix. Most
surgeons select either TA or LA based on the individual
needs and circumstances of the patient.
Insurance plans do cover the costs of appendectomy.
Fees are charged independently by the hospital and the
physicians. Hospital charges include fees for operating
and recovery room use, diagnostic and laboratory testing,
as well as the normal hospital room charges. Surgical
fees vary from region to region and range between $250-
$750. The anesthesiologist’s fee depends upon the health
of the patient and the length of the operation.
Preparation
Once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and the
decision has been made to perform an appendectomy, the
patient undergoes the standard preparation for an operation.
This usually takes only one to two hours and includes sign-
ing the operative consents, patient identification proce-
dures, evaluation by the anesthesiologist, and moving the
patient to the operating suites of the hospital. Occasionally,
if the patient has been ill for a prolonged period of time or
has had protracted vomiting, a delay of few to several hours
may be necessary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics.
Aftercare
Recovery from an appendectomy is similar to other
operations. Patients are allowed to eat when the stomach

meal is a clear liquid diet—broth, juice, soda pop, and
gelatin. If patients tolerate this meal, the next meal usually
is a regular diet. Patients are asked to walk and resume their
normal physical activities as soon as possible. If TA was
done, work and physical education classes may be restrict-
ed for a full three weeks after the operation. If a LA was
done, most patients are able to return to work and strenuous
activity within one to three weeks after the operation.
Risks
Certain risks are present when any operation requires
a general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity is opened.
Pneumoniaand collapse of the small airways (atelecta-
sis) often occurs. Patients who smoke are at a greater risk
for developing these complications. Thrombophlebitis,
or inflammation of the veins, is rare but can occur if the
patient requires prolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occur
but rarely is a blood transfusionrequired. Adhesions
(abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thin
fibrous tissue) is a known complication of any abdominal
procedure such as appendectomy. These adhesions can
lead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normal
flow of intestinal contents. Herniais a complication of
any incision, However, they are rarely seen after appen-
dectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in the
area of the standard appendectomy incision.
The overall complication rate of appendectomy
depends upon the status of the appendix at the time it is
removed. If the appendix has not ruptured the complication
rate is only about 3%. However, if the appendix has rup-
tured the complication rate rises to almost 59%. Wound
infections do occur and are more common if the appendici-
tis was severe, far advanced, or ruptured. An abscessmay
form in the abdomen as a complication of appendicitis.
Occasionally, an appendix will rupture prior to its
removal, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.
Peritonitisor a generalized infection in the abdomen
will occur. Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a rup-
tured appendix includes removal of what remains of the
appendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that promote
the flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of the
body), and antibiotics. Fistula formation (an abnormal
connection between the cecum and the skin) rarely
occurs. It is only seen if the appendix has a broad attach-
ment to the cecum and the appendicitis is far advanced
causing destruction of the cecum itself.
Normal results
Most patients feel better immediately after an opera-
tion for appendicitis. Many patients are discharged from
the hospital within 24 hours after the appendectomy.
KEY TERMS
Abscess—A collection of pus buried deep in the
tissues or in a body cavity.
Anesthesiologist—A physician who has special
training and expertise in the delivery of anesthetics.
Anesthetics—Drugs or methodologies used to
make a body area free of sensation or pain.
Cecum—The beginning of the large intestine and
the place where the appendix attaches to the
intestinal tract.
General surgeon—A physician who has special
training and expertise in performing a variety of
operations.
Pelvic organs—The organs inside of the body that
are located within the confines of the pelvis. This
includes the bladder and rectum in both sexes and
the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes in females.
Pubis—The anterior portion of the pelvis located
in the anterior abdomen.
Thrombophlebitis—Inflammation of the veins,
usually in the legs, which causes swelling and ten-
derness in the affected area.
Umbilicus—The navel.
Others may require a longer stay—three to five days.
Almost all patients are back to their normal activities
within three weeks.
The mortality rate of appendicitis has dramatically
decreased over time. Currently, the mortality rate is esti-
mated at one to twoper 1,000,000 cases of appendicitis.
Deathis usually due to peritonitis, intra abdominal
abscess or severe infection following rupture.
The complications associated with undiagnosed, mis-
diagnosised, or delayed diagnosis of appendectomy are
very significant. The diagnosis is of appendicitis is diffi-
cult and never certain. This has led surgeons to perform an
appendectomy any time that they feel appendicitis is the
diagnosis. Most surgeons feel that in approximately 20%
of their patients, a normal appendix will be removed.
Rates much lower than this would seem to indicate that the
diagnosis of appendicitis was being frequently missed.

Appendicitis
Definition
Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix,
which is the worm-shaped pouch attached to the cecum,
the beginning of the large intestine. The appendix has no
known function in the body, but it can become diseased.
Appendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is left
untreated the appendix may rupture and cause a poten-
tially fatal infection.
Description
Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emer-
gency found in children and young adults. One person in
15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The inci-
dence is highest among males aged 10-14, and among
females aged 15-19. More males than females develop
appendicitis between pubertyand age 25. It is rare in the
elderly and in children under the age of two.
The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing-
ly severe abdominal pain. Since many different condi-
tions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate diagnosis of
appendicitis can be difficult. A timely diagnosis is impor-
tant, however, because a delay can result in perforation,
or rupture, of the appendix. When this happens, the
infected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen,
potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomen
called peritonitis.
Other conditions can have similar symptoms, espe-
cially in women. These include pelvic inflammatory
disease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian
cysts, tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis. Various
forms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation may
also mimic appendicitis.
The treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendici-
tis is an appendectomy, surgery to remove the appendix.
Because of the potential for a life-threatening ruptured
appendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis are
often taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of appendicitis are not well understood,
but it is believed to occur as a result of one or more of
these factors: an obstruction within the appendix, the
development of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tis-
sue accompanied by the deathof cells) within the appen-
dix, and the invasion of bacteria.
Under these conditions, bacteria may multiply with-
in the appendix. The appendix may become swollen and
filled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue, consist-
ing of while blood cells and cellular debris), and may
eventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the presence
of symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever, a high
white blood cell count, and a fast heart rate. Very rarely,

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 341  the inflammation and symptoms of appendicitis may dis-
appear but recur again later.
The distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is pain
beginning around or above the navel. The pain, which
may be severe or only achy and uncomfortable, eventual-
ly moves into the right lower corner of the abdomen.
There, it becomes more steady and more severe, and
often increases with movement, coughing, and so forth.
The abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to the
touch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates an
increased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis.
Loss of appetite is very common. Nausea and vom-
itingmay occur in about half of the cases and occasion-
ally there may be constipationor diarrhea. The temper-
ature may be normal or slightly elevated. The presence of
a fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured.
Diagnosis
A careful examination is the best way to diagnose
appendicitis. It is often difficult even for experienced
physicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitis
from those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, very
specific questioning and a thorough physical examina-
tionare crucial. The physician should ask questions,
such as where the pain is centered, whether the pain has
shifted, and where the pain began. The physician should
press on the abdomen to judge the location of the pain
and the degree of tenderness.
The typical sequence of symptoms is present in about
50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less typical pat-
terns may be seen, especially in pregnant women, older
patients, and infants. In pregnant women, appendicitis is
easily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdom-
inal pain and nausea from other causes. Elderly patients
may feel less pain and tenderness than most patients,
thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and leading to
rupture in 30% of cases. Infants and young children often
have diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in addition to pain.
While laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno-
sis, an increased white cell count may point to appendici-
tis. Urinalysismay help to rule out a urinary tract infec-
tion that can mimic appendicitis.
Patients whose symptoms and physical examination
are compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usual-
ly taken immediately to surgery, where a laparotomy
(surgical exploration of the abdomen) is done to confirm
the diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis,
other tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT)
may be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery. An
ultrasound examination of the abdomen may help to
identify an inflamed appendix or other condition that
would explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are not
of much value except when the appendix has ruptured.
Often, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is
done. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery may be recom-
mended without delay if the symptoms point clearly to
appendicitis. If the symptoms are not clear, surgery may be
postponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis.
When appendicitis is strongly suspected in a woman
of child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy(an
examination of the interior of the abdomen) is sometimes
recommended before the appendectomy in order to be
sure that a gynecological problem, such as a ruptured
ovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this procedure, a
lighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomen
through a small incision around the navel.
A normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20% of
patients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspected
appendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will remove a nor-
mal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in the
future. During the surgery, another specific cause for the
pain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about
30% of these patients.
Treatment
The treatment of appendicitis is an immediate
appendectomy. This may be done by opening the
abdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique,
or through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller inci-
sion is made through the navel. Both methods can suc-
cessfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It is
not certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage over
open appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,
patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy may
have to be switched to the open appendectomy procedure
for the successful management of the rupture. If a rup-
tured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.
Prognosis
Appendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen-
dectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient should
recover without further problems. The mortality rate in
cases without complications is less than 0.1%. When an
appendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has developed,
the likelihood is higher for complications, with slower
recovery, or death from disease. There are higher rates of
perforation and mortality among children and the elderly.
Prevention
Appendicitis is probably not preventable, although
there is some indication that a diet high in green vegeta-
bles and tomatoes may help prevent appendicitis.

Applied kinesiology
Definition
Applied kinesiology (AK) is the study of muscles
and the relationship of muscle strength to health. It
incorporates a system of manual muscle testing and
therapy. AK is based on the theory that an organ dys-
function is accompanied by a specific muscle weakness.
Diseases are diagnosed through muscle-testing proce-
dures and then treated. AK is not the same as kinesiolo-
gy, or biomechanics, which is the scientific study of
movement.
KEY TERMS
Appendectomy (or appendicectomy)—Surgical
removal of the appendix.
Appendix—The worm-shaped pouch attached to
the cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.
Laparotomy—Surgical incision into the loin,
between the ribs and the pelvis, which offers sur-
geons a view inside the abdominal cavity.
Peritonitis—Inflammation of the peritoneum,
membranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.
Purpose
AK is not designed for crisis medicine. For example,
an AK practitioner cannot cure cancer, arthritis, dia-
betes, heart disease, or infections. This therapy is
designed to be a part of a holistic approach to preventive
medicine. The goals of AK are to (1) restore normal
nerve function, (2) achieve normal endocrine, immune,
digestive, and other internal organ functions, (3) inter-
vene early in degenerative processes to prevent or delay
pathological conditions, and to (4) restore postural bal-
ance, correct gait (walking) impairment, and improve
range of motion.
Description
Origins
AK is based on principles of functional neurology,
anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and biochemistry as
well as principles from Chinese medicine,acupuncture,
and massage. It was developed from traditional kinesiolo-
gy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor from
Detroit, Michigan. He observed that each large muscle
relates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle may mean
that there is a problem in the associated organ. Goodheart
found that by treating the muscle and making it strong
again, he was able to improve the function of the organ as
well. For example, if a particular nutritional supplement
was given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it was
the correct supplement for the patient. If the muscle
remained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatment
can be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart also
found that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat-
ed with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle,
he was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findings
in 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the first
method developed in AK. Other diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures were developed for various reflexes described
by other chiropractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporat-
ed acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading the
writings of Felix Mann, M.D.
Goodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool
that incorporates feedback from the body. He said that
“applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the body
language never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscles
were indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weakness
has been ascertained, the problem may be solved in a
variety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problem
correctly, he believed, making the proper and adequate
diagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory both
to the doctor and to the patient.
According to AK, each muscle in the body relates to
a specific meridian or energy pathway (acupuncture

Applied kinesiology
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 343  lines) in the body. These meridians also relate to organs
or glands, allowing the muscles to provide information
about organ or gland function and energy. The five areas
of diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are
(1) the nervous system, (2) the lymphatic system, (3) the
vascular (blood vessel) system, (4) the cerebrospinal sys-
tem, and (5) the meridian system.
The first part of AK is muscle testing, which is used
to help diagnose what part of the body is functioning
abnormally. Muscle testing involves putting the body
into a position that requires a certain muscle to remain
contracted, and then applying pressure against the mus-
cle. The testing does not measure strength but is meant to
reveal stresses and imbalances in the body through the
tension in the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of a
controlling system (like the nervous system) to adapt the
muscle to meet the changing pressure of the examiner’s
test. AK practitioners also examine structural factors
such as posture, gait, and range of motion. Some chiro-
GEORGE GOODHEART (1918– )
Dr. George Goodheart was born in Detroit, Michi-
gan, in 1918 and became a second-generation doctor of
chiropractic. He graduated from the National College of
Chiropractic in 1939 and is recognized as the founder
and developer of Applied Kinesiology. After he joined
the U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War II,
he received a promotion to major at the age of 22. He
was the youngest ever to attain that rank. He served in
active duty from 1941-1946 and continued as a mem-
ber of the Air Force Reserve until the mid-1950s.
Dr. Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc-
tion during his career, including director of the National
Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and director
for the International College of Applied Kinesiology-
U.S.A. He also lectured and taught throughout the Unit-
ed States, Japan, Europe, and Australia; and he was the
official doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed Winter
Olympic Games in 1980. He contributes to a variety of
trade publications on a regular basis.
In 1998 Dr. Goodheart received a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the International College of
Kinesiology. Earlier, in 1987 he was honored with the
Leonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for the
Achievement of Human Potential, and he was cited for
his research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiro-
practic. He represented the State of Michigan as a dele-
gate to the American Chiropractic Association and was
a fellow at the International College of Chiropractic. He
resides with his wife, JoAnn in Grosse Pointe Woods,
Michigan, where he enjoys skiing and tennis.
practors use AK to help them evaluate the success of
spinal adjustment. A leg muscle is tested for strength or
weakness to determine whether the adjustments made are
appropriate.
According to AK, common internal causes of mus-
cle weakness include:
• dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interference
between spine and muscles)
• impairment of lymphatic drainage
• reduction of blood supply
• abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerve-to-
muscle relationships
• blockage of an acupuncture meridian
• imbalance of chemicals
• dysfunction of organs or glands
• excesses or deficiencies in nutrition
Physiological reactions to chemicals, including
those associated with nutrition and allergies, may also be
evaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi-
cal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’s
tongue so that he tastes the material, and the normal
chemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, the
substances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi-
tioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern to
determine where or if there is a strength or weakness.
The patient does not need to swallow the substance for a
change in strength or weakness to be identified. David S.
Walther, a diplomate of the International College of
Applied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possible
that the central nervous system, recognizing the com-
pound being ingested, relays information to the organs
and glands preparing for use of the compound. If the
compound is recognized as beneficial, the energy pattern
is immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organ
or gland, but also the associated muscle.”
AK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for a
variety of conditions.

The second part of AK involves the treatment phase.
Goodheart and other practitioners of AK have adapted
many treatment methods for the problems that are diag-
nosed with muscle testing. Examples of treatment meth-
ods include special diets, dietary supplements,chiro-
practicmanipulation, osteopathic cranial techniques,
acupuncture/meridian therapies,acupressure, deep mus-
cle massage, and nervous system coordination proce-
dures. For example, an AK practitioner might treat asth-
ma by looking for weaknesses in specific lower back and
leg muscles that share a connection with the adrenal
glands. The practitioner will strengthen these muscles
and help the adrenal gland produce bronchodilators,
chemicals that relax or open air passages in the lungs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	345
Applied kinesiology
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 345  The practice of kinesiology requires that it be used
in conjunction with other standard diagnostic methods by
professionals trained in clinical diagnosis. Most practi-
tioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, medical
doctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical thera-
pists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, and
nurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2% of
4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States who
responded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro-
practic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in their
practice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31%
of chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% in
New Zealand use AK.
Most practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach
and evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec-
tive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal-
ing from a structural basis, medical doctors generally
from a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo-
gists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol-
ogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, and
in some cases, include a spiritual dimension.
The use of AK is often included in insurance cover-
age if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost of
the AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro-
practic practices.
Precautions
AK should only by used by trained professionals
with the necessary expertise to perform specific and
accurate tests. The AK examination should be combined
with a standard physical diagnosis, which often includes
laboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, and
other special tests. An AK examination should enhance a
standard diagnosis, not replace it. The total diagnostic
work-up should be used to determine the final diagnosis.
The use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri-
tion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutri-
tion sales person as a tool to sell his/her product. The per-
son should have the educational background to evaluate
nutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowl-
edge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques.
Side effects
If AK is performed by a trained practitioner with the
appropriate educational background, side effects from
the muscle-testing procedures should be minimal.
Research and general acceptance
AK is a tool that is used by many health care pro-
fessionals, and especially by chiropractors. A literature
review published in 1999 by researchers from the
School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva-
tive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that,
although AK appears to be a promising methodology,
there is a lack of research results relevant to clinical
practice and outcomes of AK care. They found this
lack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti-
lization, and changes in symptoms are the important
results of clinical practice. In addition, they determined
that some studies that were supposed to be an evalua-
tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinical
practices and principles of AK. However, from studies
adhering to AK principles and employing standardized
training by well-trained practitioners, they did state
there was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri-
fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud-
ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, including
symptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well-
designed studies that account for the individual nature
of AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the proper
clinical context of AK treatment will be informative.
Understanding the individual components of the
process of AK treatment remains important. Studies
addressing validation of isolated AK procedures need
to meet the methodological challenges of studying
appropriate subjects that reflects the current recog-
nized practice and understanding of AK. Further evalu-
ation of the basic physiologic phenomena involved and
correlation of AK manual muscle test results will also
advance understanding of this diagnostic and therapeu-
tic system.”

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 346  Arbovirus encephalitis
Definition
Encephalitisis a serious inflammation of the brain.
Arbovirus encephalitis is caused by a virus from the
Arbovirus group. The term arbovirusstands for Arthro-
pod-borne virusbecause these viruses are passed to
humans by members of the phylum Arthropoda (which
includes insects and spiders).
Description
Of the huge number of arboviruses known to exist,
about 80 types are responsible for human disease. In
addition to the virus, there are usually two other types of
living creatures involved in the cycle leading to human
disease. When large quantities of virus are present in an
arthropod (often a tick or mosquito), the viruses are
passed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropod
attempts to feed on the blood of that creature. The virus
thrives within the new host, sometimes causing illness,
sometimes not. More ticks or mosquitoes are infected
with the virus when they feed on the host’s blood. Even-
tually, a tick or mosquito bites a human, and the virus is
passed along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle only
between arthropods and humans, with no intermediate
stop in a bird or small mammal.
Because the arboviruses require an arthropod to pass
them along to humans, the most common times of year
for these illnesses include summer and fall, when mos-
quitoes and ticks are most prevalent. Damp environments
favor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus also
increase the risk of arbovirus infections.
The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include
the members of the viral families alphavirus (causing
Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis,
and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (respon-
sible for St. Louis encephalitis,Japanese encephalitis,
Tick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis,
Russian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan), and
bunyavirus (causing California encephalitis).
In the United States, the most important types of
arbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephali-
tis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louis
encephalitis, and California encephalitis. WEE strikes
young infants in particular, with a 5% chance of death
from the illness. Of those who survive, about 60% suffer
permanent brain damage. EEE strikes infants and chil-
dren, with a 20% chance of death, and a high rate of per-
manent brain damage among survivors. St. Louis
encephalitis tends to strike adults older than 40 years of
age, and older patients tend to have higher rates of death
and long-term disability from the infection. California	virus primarily strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lower	degree of permanent brain damage.
Causes and symptoms
Encephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses
have biochemical characteristics which cause them to be
particularly attracted to the cells of the brain and the
nerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,
with feverand swelling within the brain and nerves. The
membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (the
meninges) may also become inflamed, a condition called
meningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of bleed-
ing occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.
Patients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,
fever,nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, and sleepiness.
As the disease progresses, more severe symptoms devel-
op, including tremors, confusion, seizures,coma, and
paralysis. Loss of function occurs when specific nerve
areas are damaged and/or killed.
Diagnosis
Early in the disease, laboratory testing of blood may
reveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual technique
used to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injecting
the patient’s blood into the brain of a newborn mouse,
then waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitis.
Diagnosis is usually based on the patient’s symptoms,
history of tick or mosquito bites, and knowledge that the
patient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus.
Treatment
Treatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is direct-
ed at improving the symptoms, but does not shorten the
course of the illness. The main concerns of treatment
involve lowering fever, treating pain, avoiding dehydra-
tionor other chemical imbalances, and decreasing
swelling in the brain with steroids.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the particular type of
arbovirus causing disease, and on the age and prior
health status of the patient. Death rates range all the way
up to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates of
lifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for some
types of arboviruses.
Prevention
Prevention involves avoiding contact with arthro-
pods which carry these viruses. This means wearing

areas known to be infested. Insecticides and the avoid-
ance of collections of standing water (which are good
breeding ground for arthropods) is also effective at
decreasing arthropod populations.
There are immunizations available against EEE and
WEE. These have primarily been used to safeguard labo-
ratory workers who have regular exposure to these viruses.

Definition
Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of plant-
derived, aromatic essential oils to promote physical and
psychological well-being. It is sometimes used in combi-
nation with massage and other therapeutic techniques as
part of a holistic treatment approach.
Purpose
Aromatherapy offers diverse physical and psycho-
logical benefits, depending on the essential oil or oil
combination and method of application used. Some com-
mon medicinal properties of essential oils used in aro-
matherapy include: analgesic, antimicrobial, antiseptic,

anti-inflammatory, astringent, sedative, antispasmodic,
expectorant, diuretic, and sedative. Essential oils are
used to treat a wide range of symptoms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal discomfort,
skin conditions, menstrual painand irregularities, stress-
related conditions,mood disorders, circulatory prob-
lems, respiratory infections, and wounds.
Description
Origins
Aromatic plants have been employed for their heal-
ing, preservative, and pleasurable qualities throughout
recorded history in both the East and West. As early as
1500 
B.C. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils,
incense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals for
their religious ceremonies.
There is evidence that the Chinese may have recog-
nized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies much
earlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, Shen
Nung’s Pen Ts’ao(c. 2700-3000 
B.C.) catalogs over 200
botanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indian
medicine that dates back over 2,500 years, also used aro-
matic herbs for treatment.
The Romans were well-known for their use of fra-
grances. They bathed with botanicals and integrated
them into their state and religious rituals. So did the
Greeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal prop-
erties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeon
Pedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text De
Materia Medica(60 
A.D.) was the standard textbook for
Western medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively on
the medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The Medica
contained detailed information on over 500 plants and
4,740 separate medicinal uses for them, including an
entire section on aromatics.
Written records of herbal distillation are found as early
as the first century 
A.D., and around 1000 A.D., the noted
Arab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distil-
lation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medicinal prop-
erties of essential oils in his writings. However, it wasn’t
until 1937, when French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossé
published Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hor-
mones végé tales, that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, was
introduced in Europe as a medical discipline. Gattefossé,
who was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered the
healing properties of lavender oil quite by accident when
he suffered a severe burn while working and used the clos-
est available liquid, lavender oil, to soak it in.
In the late 20th century, French physician Jean Valnet
used botanical aromatics as a front line treatment for
wounded soldiers in World War II. He wrote about his use
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2348
Aromatherapy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 348  of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic properties,
in his 1964 book Aromatherapie, traitement des maladies
par les essences des plantes, which popularized the use of
essential oils for medical and psychiatric treatment through-
out France. Later, French biochemist Mauguerite Maury
popularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils, and in
1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English language
book on the subject,The Art of Aromatherapy, which intro-
duced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy and
sparked its popularity in the United Kingdom.
In aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully selected
for their medicinal properties. As essential oils are
absorbed into the bloodstream through application to the
skin or inhalation, their active components trigger certain
pharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief).
In addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy has
strong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil, or
the speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought to
be linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil. As
a rule of thumb, oils that evaporate quickly are consid-
ered emotionally uplifting, while slowly-evaporating oils
are thought to have a calming effect.
Essential oils commonly used in aromatherapy treat-
ment include:
• Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobilis). An anti-
inflammatory and analgesic. Useful in treating otitis
media(earache), skin conditions, menstrual pains, and
depression.
• Clary sage (Salvia sclarea). This natural astringent is
not only used to treat oily hair and skin, but is also said
to be useful in regulating the menstrual cycle, improv-
ing mood, and controlling high blood pressure. Clary
sage should not be used by pregnant women.
• Lavender (Lavandula officinalis). A popular aromather-
apy oil which mixes well with most essential oils,
lavender has a wide range of medicinal and cosmetic
applications, including treatment of insect bites,burns,
respiratory infections, intestinal discomfort, nausea,
migraine,insomnia, depression, and stress.
• Myrtle (Myrtus communis). Myrtle is a fungicide, dis-
infectant, and antibacterial. It is often used in steam
aromatherapy treatments to alleviate the symptoms of
whooping cough,bronchitis, and other respiratory
infections.
• Neroli (bitter orange), (Citrus aurantium). Citrus oil
extracted from bitter orange flower and peel and used to
treat sore throat, insomnia, and stress and anxiety-
related conditions.
• Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). An essential oil used to
treat stomach complaints and known for its reported
ability to lift the mood while relieving stress.
• Peppermint (Mentha piperita). Relaxes and soothes the
stomach muscles and gastrointestinal tract. Pepper-
mint’s actions as an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and
antimicrobial also make it an effective skin treatment,
and useful in fighting cold and flu symptoms.
• Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Stimulating essen-
tial oil used to treat muscular and rheumatic com-
plaints, as well as low blood pressure, gastrointestinal
problems, and headaches.
• Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia). Has bactericidal,
virucidal, fungicidal, and anti-inflammatory properties
that make it a good choice for fighting infection. Rec-
ommended for treating sore throat and respiratory
infections, vaginal and bladder infections, wounds, and
a variety of skin conditions.

Essential oils contain active agents that can have
potent physical effects. While some basic aromatherapy
home treatments can be self-administered, medical aro-
matherapy should always be performed under the guid-
ance of an aromatherapist, herbalist, massage therapist,
nurse, or physician.
Inhalation
The most basic method of administering aromather-
apy is direct or indirect inhalation of essential oils. Sev-
eral drops of an essential oil can be applied to a tissue or

As a holistic therapy, aromatherapy is believed to benefit

essential oil can also be added to a bowl of hot water and
used as a steam treatment. This technique is recommend-
ed when aromatherapy is used to treat respiratory and/or
skin conditions. Aromatherapy steam devices are also
available commercially. A warm bath containing essen-
tial oils can have the same effect as steam aromatherapy,
with the added benefit of promoting relaxation. When
used in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather than hot
to slow the evaporation of the oil.
Essential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulb
rings can be used to disperse essential oils over a large
area. These devices can be particularly effective in aro-
matherapy that uses essential oils to promote a healthier
home environment. For example, eucalyptus and tea tree
oil are known for their antiseptic qualities and are fre-
quently used to disinfect sickrooms, and citronella and
geranium can be useful in repelling insects.
Direct application
Because of their potency, essential oils are diluted in
a carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the skin to
prevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil can be a
vegetable or olive based one, such as wheat germ or avo-
cado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet almond, grape-
seed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach kernel, may be
absorbed more easily by the skin. Standard dilutions of
essential oils in carrier oils range from 2–10%. However,
some oils can be used at higher concentrations, and oth-
ers should be diluted further for safe and effective use.
The type of carrier oil used and the therapeutic use of the
application may also influence how the essential oil is
mixed. Individuals should seek guidance from a health-
care professional and/or aromatherapist when diluting
essential oils.
Massage is a common therapeutic technique used in
conjunction with aromatherapy to both relax the body
and thoroughly administer the essential oil treatment.
Essential oils can also be used in hot or cold compresses
and soaks to treat muscle aches and pains (e.g., lavender
and ginger). As a sore throat remedy, antiseptic and
soothing essential oils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can be
thoroughly mixed with water and used as a gargle or
mouthwash.
Internal use
Some essential oils can be administered internally in
tincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat certain
symptoms or conditions; however, this treatment should
never be self-administered. Essential oils should only be
taken internally under the supervision of a qualified
healthcare professional.
As non-prescription botanical preparations, the
essential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not paid
for by health insurance. The self-administered nature of
the therapy controls costs to some degree. Aromatherapy
treatment sessions from a professional aromatherapist
are not covered by health insurance in most cases,
although aromatherapy performed in conjunction with
physical therapy, nursing, therapeutic massage, or other
covered medical services may be. Individuals should
check with their insurance provider to find out about
their specific coverage.
The adage “You get what you pay for” usually
applies when purchasing essential oils, as bargain oils are

can be expensive; and the cost of an oil will vary depend-
ing on its quality and availability.
Preparations
The method of extracting an essential oil varies by
plant type. Common methods include water or steam dis-
tillation and cold pressing. Quality essential oils should
be unadulterated and extracted from pure botanicals.
Many aromatherapy oils on the market are synthetic
and/or diluted, contain solvents, or are extracted from
botanicals grown with pesticides or herbicides. To ensure
best results, essential oils should be made from pure
organic botanicals and labeled by their full botanical
name. Oils should always be stored dark bottles out of
direct light.
Before using essential oils on the skin, individuals
should perform a skin patch test by applying a small
amount of the diluted oil behind the wrist and covering it
with a bandage or cloth for up to 12 hours. If redness or
irritation occurs, the oil should be diluted further and a
second skin test performed, or it should be avoided alto-
gether. Individuals should never apply undiluted essen-
tial oils to the skin unless advised to do so by a trained
healthcare professional.
Precautions
Individuals should only take essential oils internally
under the guidance and close supervision of a health-care
professional. Some oils, such as eucalyptus, wormwood,

healthcare provider before starting treatment with any
essential oil.
Asthmatic individuals should not use steam inhala-
tion for aromatherapy, as it can aggravate their condition.
Essential oils are flammable, and should be kept
away from heat sources.
Side effects
Side effects vary by the type of essential oil used.
Citrus-based essential oils can cause heightened sensitivi-
ty to sunlight. Essential oils may also cause contact der-
matitis, an allergic reaction characterized by redness and
irritation. Anyone experiencing an allergic reaction to an
essential oil should discontinue its use and contact their
healthcare professional for further guidance. Individuals
should do a small skin patch test with new essential oils
before using them extensively (see “Preparations” above).
Research and general acceptance
The antiseptic and bactericidal qualities of some
essential oils (such as tea tree and peppermint) and their
value in fighting infection has been detailed extensively
in both ancient and modern medical literature.
Recent research in mainstream medical literature
has also shown that aromatherapy has a positive psycho-
logical impact on patients, as well. Several clinical stud-
ies involving both post-operative and chronically ill sub-
jects showed that massage with essential oils can be
helpful in improving emotional well-being, and conse-
quently, promoting the healing process.
Today, the use of holistic aromatherapy is widely
accepted in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, where
it is commonly used in conjunction with massage as both
a psychological and physiological healing tool. In the
United States, where aromatherapy is often misunder-
stood as solely a cosmetic treatment, the mainstream
medical community has been slower to accept it.

Arrhythmias
Definition
An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the heart’s rhythm,
or heartbeat pattern. The heartbeat can be too slow, too fast,
have extra beats, skip a beat, or otherwise beat irregularly.
Description
Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadence
of the heartbeat, which cause the heart to pump improp-
erly. The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium,
where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus node)
sends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to the
atrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node then
sends signals into the main pumping chamber to make
the ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heart-
beat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node,
an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, or
a heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signal
from traveling down the normal pathway.
More than four million Americans have arrhythmias,
most of which are harmless. Middle-aged adults common-
ly experience arrhythmias. As people age, the probability
of experiencing an arrhythmia increases. Arrhythmias
often occur in people who do not have heart disease. In
people with heart disease, it is usually the heart disease
which is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias often
occur during and after heart attacks. Some types of
arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, are serious
and even life threatening. In the United States, arrhythmias
are the primary cause of sudden cardiac death, account-
ing for more than 350,000 deaths each year.
Slow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are
called bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than 100
beats per minute) are called tachycardias. Bradycardia
can result in poor circulation of blood, and, hence, a lack
of oxygen throughout the body, especially the brain.
Tachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability to
pump effectively because the ventricles do not have
enough time to completely fill.
Arrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin:
the atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular arrhythmias
occur in the upper areas of the heart and are less serious
than ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillationis
the most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medical
help is immediate.
Causes and symptoms
In many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is
unknown. Known causes of arrhythmias include heart
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2352
Arrhythmias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 352  disease,stress,caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet pills, and
decongestantsin coughand cold medicines.
Symptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heartbeat,
pounding or fluttering chest sensations, skipping a heart-
beat, “flip-flops,”dizziness, faintness,shortness of
breath, and chest pains.
Diagnosis
Examination with a stethoscope, electrocardio-
grams, and electrophysiologic studies is used to diagnose
arrhythmias. Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified by
listening to the patient’s heart through a stethoscope, but,
since arrhythmias are not always present, they may not
occur during the physical exam.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s
activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circu-
lation (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting
jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.
They send impulses of the heart’s activity through an
electrical activity monitor (oscilloscope) to a recorder
that traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 min-
utes and is performed in a physician’s office. Another
type of ECG, commonly known as the exercisestress
test, measures how the heart and blood vessels respond
to exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmill
or a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physi-
cian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30
minutes. Other types of ECGs include 24-hour ECG
monitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hour
ECG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small,
portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chest
that record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.
Transtelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias that
occur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring,
transtelephonic monitoring can continue for days or
weeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via tele-
phone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt,
or the patient can store the information in the recorder
and transmit it later.
Electrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures
performed in a hospital to identify the origin of serious
arrhythmias and responses to various treatments. They
involve cardiac catheterization, in which catheters
tipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the arm
or leg through the blood vessels into the heart. The elec-
trodes record impulses in the heart, highlighting where
the arrhythmia starts. During the procedure, physicians
can test the effects of various drugs by provoking an
arrhythmia through the electrodes and trying different
drugs. The procedure takes one to three hours, during
which the patient is awake but mildly sedated. Local
anesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sites.
Treatment
Many arrhythmias do not require any treatment. For
serious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart disease
sometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some cases, the
arrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock (car-
dioversion), automatic implantable defibrillators, artificial
pacemakers,catheter ablation, or surgery. Supraventricu-
lar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy. Ven-
tricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat.
Drug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but
finding the right drug and dose requires care and can take
some time. Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmias
include beta-blockers,calcium channel blockers, quini-
dine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Because
of their potential serious side effects, stronger, desensi-
tizing drugs are used only to treat life-threatening
arrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmias
have possible side effects, ranging from mild complica-
tions with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers to
more serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, para-
doxically, cause arrhythmias or make them worse.
Response to drugs is usually measured by ECG, Holter
monitor, or electrophysiologic study.
In emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrilla-
tion(the application of an electrical shock to the chest
wall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart to its nor-
mal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to prevent
recurrence of the arrhythmia.
Artificial pacemakers that send electrical signals to
make the heart beat properly can be implanted under the
skin during a simple operation. Leads from the pacemak-
er are anchored to the right side of the heart. Pacemakers
are used to correct bradycardia and are sometimes used
after surgical or catheter ablation.
Automatic implantable defibrillators correct life-
threatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing them
and then restoring a normal heart rhythm by pacing the
heart or giving it an electric shock. They are implanted
within the chest wall without major surgery and store
information for future evaluation by physicians. Auto-
matic implantable defibrillators have proven to be more
effective in saving lives than drugs alone. They often are
used in conjunction with drug therapy.
Ablation, a procedure to alter or remove the heart
tissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recur-
rence, can be performed through a catheter or surgery.
Supraventricular tachycardia can be treated successfully
with ablation. Catheter ablation is performed in a
catheterization laboratory with the patient under seda-
tion. A catheter equipped with a device that maps the
heart’s electrical pathways is inserted into a vein and is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	353
Arrhythmias
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 353  threaded into the heart. High-frequency radio waves are
then used to remove the pathway(s) causing the arrhyth-
mia. Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is per-
formed in a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radio
waves to destroy tissue. Ablation treatments are used
when medications fail.
Maze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by making
multiple incisions through the atrium to allow electrical
impulses to move effectively. This is often recommended
for patients who have not responded to drugs or car-
dioversion.
Alternative treatment
Since some arrhythmias can be life threatening, a
conventional medical doctor should always be consulted
first. Acupuncturecan correct an insignificant number
(1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new, minor arrhyth-
mias, acupuncture may be effective in up to 70% of cases,
but this figure may not differ much from placebo therapy.
Both western and Chinese herbal remedies are also used
in the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn (Cratae-
gus laevigata) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the
heart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It is
gentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove
(Digitalis purpurea), an herb whose action on the heart is
too potent for use without supervision by a qualified prac-
titioner. Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe reme-
dies such as Lachesisand aconite or monkshood (Aconi-
tum napellus) to treat mild arrhythmias.
Prognosis
Advances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs, and
medical technology have extended the lives of many
patients with serious arrhythmias. Diagnostic techniques
enable physicians to accurately identify arrhythmias,
while new drugs, advances in pacemaker technology, the
development of implantable defibrillators, and progress
in ablative techniques offer effective treatments for many
types of arrhythmia.
Prevention
Some arrhythmias can be prevented by managing
stress, controlling anxiety, and avoiding caffeine, alco-
hol, decongestants,cocaine, and cigarettes.

Arterial embolism
Definition
An embolus is a blood clot, bit of tissue or tumor,
gas bubble, or other foreign body that circulates in the
blood stream until it becomes stuck in a blood vessel.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2354
Arterial embolism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 354  Description
When a blood clot develops in an artery and remains
in place, it is called a thrombosis. If all or part of the
blockage breaks away and lodges in another part of the
artery, it is called an embolism. Blockage of an artery in
this manner can be the result of a blood clot, fat cells, or
an air bubble.
When an embolus blocks the flow of blood in an
artery, the tissues beyond the plug are deprived of normal
blood flow and oxygen. This can cause severe damage
and even deathof the tissues involved.
Emboli can affect any part of the body. The most
common sites are the legs and feet. When the brain is
affected, it is called a stroke. When the heart is involved,
it is called a heart attackor myocardial infarction (MI).
Causes and symptoms
A common cause of embolus is when an artery
whose lining has become thickened or damaged, usually
with age, allows cholesterol to build up more easily than
normal on the artery wall. If some of the cholesterol
breaks off, it forms an embolus. Emboli also commonly
form from blood clots in a heart that has been damaged
from heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormally
from arterial fibrillation.
Other known causes are fat cells that enter the blood
after a major bone fracture, infected blood cells,cancer
cells that enter the blood stream, and small gas bubbles.
Symptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or build
slowly over time, depending on the amount of blocked
blood flow.
If the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be mus-
cle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color, lower
temperature in the limb, and weakness or loss of muscle
function. If it occurs in an internal organ, there is usually
pain and/or loss of the organ’s function.
Diagnosis
The following tests can be used to confirm the pres-
ence of an arterial embolism:
• Electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG or ECG. For
this test, patches that detect electrical impulses from the
heart are attached to the chest and extremities. The infor-
mation is displayed on a monitor screen or a paper tape
in the form of waves. Reduced blood and oxygen supply
to the heart shows as a change in the shape of the waves.
• Noninvasive vascular tests. These involve measuring
blood pressure in various parts of the body and compar-
ing the results from each location. When there is a

ering of the arteries.

builds and remains in one place.
decrease in blood pressure beyond what is normal
between two points, a blockage is presumed to be present.
•Angiography. In this procedure, a colored liquid mate-
rial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be seen with x
rays is injected into the blood stream through a small
tube called a catheter. As the dye fills the arteries, they
are easily seen on x ray motion pictures. If there is a
blockage in the artery, it shows up as a sudden cut off in
the movement of contrast material. Angiography is an
expensive procedure and does carry some risk. The
catheter may cause a blood clot to form, blocking blood
flow. There is also the risk of poking the catheter
through the artery or heart muscle. Some people may
be allergic to the dye. The risk of any of these injuries
occurring is small.
Treatment
Arterial embolism can be treated with medication or
surgery, depending on the extent and location of the
blockage.
Medication to dissolve the clot is usually given
through a catheter directly into the affected artery. If the
embolus was caused by a blood clot, medications that
thin the blood will help reduce the risk of another
embolism.
A surgeon can remove an embolus by making an
incision in the artery above the blockage and, using a
catheter inserted past the embolus, drag it out through the
incision.
If the condition is severe, a surgeon may elect to
bypass the blocked vessel by grafting a new vessel in its
place.
Prognosis
An arterial embolism is serious and should be treat-
ed promptly to avoid permanent damage to the affected
area. The outcome of any treatment depends on the loca-
tion and seriousness of the embolism. New arterial
emboli can form even after successful treatment of the
first event.

Definition
An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal channel or
passage between an artery and a vein.
Description
An arteriovenous fistula is a disruption of the normal
blood flow pattern. Normally, oxygenated blood flows to
the tissue through arteries and capillaries. Following the
release of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to the
heart in veins. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal con-
nection of an artery and a vein. The blood bypasses the cap-
illaries and tissues, and returns to the heart. Arterial blood
has a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swelling
of veins involved in a fistula. Although both the artery and
the vein retain their normal connections, the new opening
between the two will cause some arterial blood to shunt
into the vein because of the blood pressure difference.
Causes and symptoms
There are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congen-
ital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is one
that formed during fetal development. It is a birth defect.
KEY TERMS
Congenital—Present at the time of birth.
In congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the lower extremity
are more frequently involved than other areas of the body.
Congenital fistulas are not common. An acquired arteri-
ovenous fistula is one that develops after a person is born.
It usually occurs when an artery and vein that are side-by-
side are damaged and the healing process results in the
two becoming linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenous
fistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial punc-
ture in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparent
cause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physicians
perform surgery to create a fistula. These patients receive
many needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysis
machines and for routine blood analysis testing. The veins
used may scar and become difficult to use. Surgery is used
to connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressure
and flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance of
blood clots forming inside the vein.
The main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near
the surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veins.
In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken for
varicose veins. Other fistulas can cause more serious
problems depending on their location and the blood ves-
sels involved.
Diagnosis
Using a stethoscope, a physician can detect the
sound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound is
a distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can be
tracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.
Treatment
Small arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by
surgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult to
treat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injection
therapy may be used. Injection therapy is the injection of
substances that cause the blood to clot at the site of the
injection. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, the
blood clot should stop the passage of blood from the
artery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to correct
acquired fistulas once they are diagnosed.

Arteriovenous malformations
Definition
Arteriovenous malformations are blood vessel
defects that occur before birth when the fetus is growing
in the uterus (prenatal development). The blood vessels
appear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins. They do
not possess the capillary (very fine blood vessels) bed
which normally exists in the common area where the
arteries and veins lie in close proximity (artery-vein
interface). An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may
hemorrhage, or bleed, leading to serious complications
that can be life-threatening.
Description
AVMs represent an abnormal interface between
arteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenated
blood to the body’s tissues through progressively smaller
blood vessels. The smallest are capillaries, which form a
web of blood vessels (the capillary bed) through the
body’s tissues. The arterial blood moves through tissues
by these tiny pathways, exchanging its load of oxygen
and nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste products
produced by the body cells (cellular wastes). The blood is
carried away by progressively larger blood vessels, the
veins. AVMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood is
moved (shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.
AVMs can occur anywhere in the body and have been
found in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart, liver, and
kidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are locat-
ed in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Owing to the
possibility of hemorrhaging, such AVMs carry the risk of
stroke,paralysis, and the loss of speech, memory, or
vision. An AVM that hemorrhages can be fatal.
Approximately three of every 100,000 people have a
cerebral AVM and roughly 40-80% of them will experi-
ence some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels at
some point. The annual risk of an AVM bleeding is esti-
mated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the risk of bleeding
decreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intense
physical activity do not seem to be associated with AVM
hemorrhage, but pregnancyand labor could cause a rup-
ture or breaking open of a blood vessel. An AVM hemor-
rhage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture. (An
aneurysm is a swollen, blood filled vessel where the
pressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outward.)
There is an approximate 10% fatality rate associated with
AVM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate for
ruptured aneurysms.
Although AVMs are congenital defects, meaning a
person is born with them, they are rarely discovered
before age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for some
AVMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. The
majority of AVMs are discovered in people age 20-40.
Medical researchers estimate that the malformations are
created during days 45-60 of fetal development. A sec-
ond theory suggests that AVMs are primitive structures
that are left over from the period when fetal blood circu-
lating systems began to develop.
However they form, AVMs have blood vessels that
are abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed into the
malformation are unusually swollen and thin walled.
They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue and
elastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These blood vessels
commonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts and
hyalin. The venous part of the malformation receives
blood directly from the artery. Without the intervening
capillary bed, the veins receive blood at a higher pressure
than they were designed to handle. This part of the mal-
formation is also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. There
is a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near an
AVM, increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain dam-
age, and death. Approximately 10-15% of AVMs are
accompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysm
that looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall of
the blood vessel.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 357  Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries,
there is often an abnormal proliferation of capillaries
next to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the mal-
formation, causing it to grow larger in some cases. As the
AVM receives more blood through this “steal,” adjacent
brain tissue does not receive enough. These areas show
abnormal nerve cell growth, cell death, and deposits of
calcium in that area (calcification). Nerve cells within the
malformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and are
believed to be nonfunctional.
Causes and symptoms
Most people do not realize that they have an AVM
unless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms.
Small AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a hemor-
rhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache.
The headache may be focused in one specific area or it
may be more general. It can be mistaken for a migraine
in some cases. The headache is accompanied by other
symptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff neck, sleepiness,
lethargy, confusion, irritability, or weakness anywhere in
the body. Seizures occur in about a quarter of AVM
cases. A person may experience decreased, double, or
blurred vision. Hemorrhaging from an AVM is generally
less dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm,
with a survival rate of 80-90%.
Other symptoms occur less frequently, but some-
times appear alongside major symptoms such as the sud-
den severe headache. Additional warning signs of a
bleeding AVM are impaired speech or smell,fainting,
facial paralysis, a drooping eyelid,dizziness, and ringing
or buzzing in the ears.
Although large AVMs are less likely to hemorrhage,
they can induce symptoms based on their mass alone.
Large AVMs exert pressure against brain tissue, cause
abnormal development in the surrounding brain tissue,
and slow down or block blood flow. Hydrocephalus,a
swelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluids,
may develop. The warning signs associated with a large
non-bleeding AVM are similar to the symptoms of a
small malformation that is bleeding. Unexplained
headaches, seizures, dizziness, and neurological symp-
toms, such as sensory changes, are signals that demand
medical attention.
Diagnosis
Based on the clinical symptoms such as severe
headache and neurological problems, and after a com-
plete neurologic exam, a computed tomography scan
(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a whoosh-
ing sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jaw
(called a bruit), can be heard with a stethoscope. The CT
scan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in the
brain and can identify AVMs larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).
Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is also used to
identify an AVM. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may
follow the MRI or CT scan. A lumbar puncture involves
removing a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the
lower part of the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdown
products in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding.
To pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a cere-
bral angiographyis done. This procedure uses x rays to
map out the blood vessels in the brain, including the ves-
sels that feed into the malformation. The information
gained from angiography complements the MRI and
helps distinguish the precise location of the AVM.
Treatment
Neurosurgeons consider several factors before
deciding on a treatment option. There is some debate
over whether or not to treat AVMs that have not rup-
tured and are not causing any symptoms. The risks and
benefits of proceeding with treatment need to be mea-
sured on an individual basis, taking into account factors
such as the person’s age and general health, as well as
the AVM’s size and location. Several treatment options
are available, both for symptomatic or asymptomatic
AVMs. These treatment options may be used alone or in
combination.
Surgery
Removing the AVM is the surest way of preventing
it from causing future problems. Both small and large
AVMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommend-
ed for superficial AVMs, but may be too dangerous for
deep or very large AVMs. Unless it is an emergency situ-
ation, an AVM that has hemorrhaged is treated conserva-
tively for several weeks. Conservative treatment consists
of managing the immediate symptoms and allowing the
patient’s condition to stabilize. Surgery requires general
anesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than any
other treatment option.
Radiation
Radiation is particularly useful to treat small (under
1 in) malformations that are deep within the brain. Ioniz-
ing radiation is directed at the malformation, destroying
the AVM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radi-
ation treatment is accomplished in a single session and it
is not necessary to open the skull. However, success can
only be measured over the course of the following two
years. A year after the procedure, 50-75% of treated
AVMs are completely blocked; two years after radiation
treatment, the percentage increases to 85-95%.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 358  Embolization
Embolization involves plugging up access to the mal-
formation. This technique does not require opening the
skull to expose the brain and can be used to treat deep
AVMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a catheter is
threaded through the artery in the thigh (femoral artery) to
the affected area. The patient remains awake during the
procedure and medications can be administered to pre-
vent discomfort. The blood vessel leading into the AVM
is assessed for its importance to the rest of the brain
before a balloon or other blocking agent is inserted via the
catheter. The block chokes off the blood supply to the
malformation. There may be a mild headache or nausea
associated with the procedure, but patients may resume
normal activities after leaving the hospital. At least two to
three embolization procedures are usually necessary at
intervals of two to six weeks. At least a three-day hospital
stay is associated with each embolization.
Prognosis
Approximately 10% of AVM cases are fatal. Seizures
and neurological changes may be permanent in another
10-30% cases of AVM rupture. If an AVM bleeds once, it
is about 20% likely to bleed again in the next year. As
time passes from the initial hemorrhage, the risk for fur-
ther bleeding drops to about 3-4%. If the AVM has not
bled, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that it never will.
Untreated AVMs can grow larger over time and rarely go
away by themselves. Once an AVM is removed and a per-

Arthrography
Definition
Arthrograpy is a procedure involving multiple x rays of
a joint using a fluoroscope, or a special piece of x-ray equip-
ment which shows an immediate x-ray image. A contrast
medium (in this case, a contrast iodine solution) injected
into the joint area helps highlight structures of the joint.
Purpose
Frequently, arthrography is ordered to determine the
cause of unexplained joint pain. This fluoroscopic proce-
dure can show the internal workings of specific joints
and outline soft tissue structures. The procedure may
also be conducted to identify problems with the liga-
ments, cartilage, tendons, or the joint capsule of the hip,
shoulder, knee, ankle or wrist. An arthrography proce-
dure may locate cysts in the joint area, evaluate problems
with the joint’s arrangement and function, or indicate the

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 359  need for joint replacement(prostheses). The most com-
monly studied joints are the knee and shoulder.
Precautions
Patients who are pregnant or may be pregnant
should not have this procedure unless the benefits of the
findings outweigh the risk of radiation exposure. Patients
who are known to be allergic to iodine need to discuss
this complication with their physician. Patients who have
a known allergy to shellfish are more likely to be allergic
to iodine contrast.
Description
Arthrograpy may be referred to as “joint radiography”
or “x rays of the joint.” The term arthrogram may be used
interchangeably with arthrography. The joint area will be
cleaned and a local anesthetic will be injected into the tis-
sues around the joint to reduce pain. Next, if fluids are pre-
sent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-
rate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato-
ry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected into
the joint through the same location by attaching the aspi-
rating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium.
The purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is to
help highlight details of areas under study by making them
opaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air and
water-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine.
Air and iodine may be used together or independently.
After the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec-
tion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to move
the joint around to distribute the contrast.
Before the contrast medium can be absorbed by the
joint itself, several films will be quickly taken under the
guidance of the fluoroscope. The patient will be asked to
move the joint into a series of positions, keeping still
between positioning. Sometimes, the patient will experience
some tingling or discomfort during the procedure, which is
normal and due to the contrast. Following fluoroscopic
tracking of the contrast, standard x rays of the area may also
be taken. The entire procedure will last about one hour.
Preparation
It is important to discuss any known sensitivity to
local anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. A
physician should explain the procedure and the risks
associated with contrast agents and ask the patient to sign
an informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis-
tered, the patient may be instructed not to eat before the
exam. The timeframe of fastingmay extend from only
90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night before.
There is no other preparation necessary.
Aftercare
The affected joint should be rested for approximate-
ly 12 hours following the procedure. The joint may be
wrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient should
receive instructions on the care and changing of the ban-
dage. Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking are
normal for a few days following arthrography. These
noises are the result of liquid in the joints. Swelling may
also occur and can be treated with application of ice or
cold packs. A mild pain reliever can be used to lessen
pain in the first few days. However, if any of these symp-
toms persist for more than a few days, patients are
advised to contact their physician.
Risks
In some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions,
ranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular or
nervous system complications. Since the contrast dye is
put into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactions
are rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast exams
should meet requirements for equipment, supplies and
staff training to handle a possible severe reaction. Infec-
tion or joint damage are possible, although not frequent,
complications of arthrography.
Normal results
A normal arthrography exam will show proper
placement of the dye or contrast medium throughout the
joint structures, joint space, cartilage and ligaments.
Abnormal results
The abnormal placement of dye may indicate
rheumatoid arthritis, cysts, joint dislocation, rupture of

Arthroplasty
Definition
Arthroplasty is surgery to relieve painand restore
range of motion by realigning or reconstructing a joint.
KEY TERMS
Aspirate—Remove fluids by suction, often through
a needle.
Contrast (agent, medium)—A substance injected
into the body that illuminates certain structures
that would otherwise be hard to see on the radi-
ograph(film).
Fluoroscope—A device used in some radiology
procedures that provides immediate images and
motion on a screen much like those seen at airport
baggage security stations.
Radiologist—A medical doctor specially trained in
radiology (x ray) interpretation and its use in the
diagnosis of diseases and injuries.
X ray—A form of electromagnetic radiation with
shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays can
penetrate most structures.
Purpose
The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a
stiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of arthroplastic
surgery exist. Joint resection involves removing a portion
of the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap between
the bone and the socket, to improve the range of motion.
Scar tissue eventually fills the gap. Pain is relieved and
motion is restored, but the joint is less stable.
Interpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshape
the joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bones
forming the joint. The prosthesis can be made of plastic
and metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skin.
When interpositional reconstruction fails, total joint
replacementmay be necessary. Joint replacement is also
called total joint arthroplasty.
In recent years, joint replacement has become the oper-
ation of choice for most knee and hip problems. Elbow,
shoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more likely to be treat-
ed with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.
Arthroplasty is performed on people suffering from
severe pain and disabling joint stiffness that result from
osteoarthritisor rheumatoid arthritis. Joint resection,
rather than joint replacement, is more likely to be per-
formed on people with rheumatoid arthritis, especially
when the elbow joint is involved. Total joint replacement
is usually reserved for people over the age of 60.
Precautions
If both the bone and socket of a joint are damaged,
joint replacement is usually the preferred treatment.
Description
Arthroplasty is performed under general or regional
anesthesia in a hospital, by an orthopedic surgeon. Cer-
tain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and tend
to have higher success rates than less specialized centers.
In joint resection, the surgeon makes an incision at
the joint, then carefully removes minimum amount of
bone necessary to allow free motion. The more bone that
remains, the more stable the joint. Ligament attachments
are preserved as much as possible. In interpositional
reconstruction, both bones of the joint are reshaped, and
a disk of material is placed between the bones to prevent
their rubbing together. Length of hospital stay depends
on which joint is treated, but is normally only a few days.
Preparation
Prior to arthroplasty, all the standard preoperative
blood and urine tests are performed. The patient meets

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 361  with the anesthesiologist to discuss any special condi-
tions that affect the administration of anesthesia.
Aftercare
Patients who have undergone arthroplasty must be
careful not to over stressor destabilize the joint. Physical
therapy is begun immediately. Antibioticsare given to
prevent infection.
Risks
Joint resection and interpositional reconstruction do
not always produce successful results, especially in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Repeat surgery or total
joint replacement may be necessary. As with any major
surgery, there is always a risk of an allergic reaction to
anesthesia or that blood clots will break loose and
obstruct the arteries.
Normal results
Most patients recover with improved range of
motion in the joint and relief from pain.

from the Greek words arthron,which means joint,and
skopein,which means to look at.	Purpose
Arthroscopic surgery is used to identify, monitor,
and diagnose joint injuries and disease; or to remove
bone or cartilage or repair tendons or ligaments. Diag-
nostic arthroscopic surgery is performed when medical
history, physical exam, x rays, and other tests such as
MRIs or CTs don’t provide a definitive diagnosis.
Precautions
Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery should not be per-
formed unless conservative treatment does not fix the
problem.
Description
In arthroscopic surgery, an orthopedic surgeon uses
an arthroscope, a fiber-optic instrument, to see the inside
of a joint. After making an incision about the size of a
buttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile sodium chloride
solution is injected to distend the joint. The arthroscope,
an instrument the size of a pencil, is then inserted into the
joint. The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting system
through which the structures inside the joint are transmit-
ted to a miniature television camera attached to the end
of the arthroscope. The surgeon uses irrigation and suc-
tion to remove blood and debris from the joint before
examining it. Other incisions may be made in order to
see other parts of the joint or to insert additional instru-
ments. Looking at the interior of the joint on the televi-
sion screen, the surgeon can then determine the amount
or type of injury and, if necessary, take a biopsy speci-
men or repair or correct the problem. Arthroscopic
surgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilage
and treat minor tears and other disorders. When the pro-
cedure is finished, the arthroscope is removed and the
joint is irrigated. The site of the incision is bandaged.
Arthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treat
joint problems, most commonly in the knee, but also in the
shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and hip. Some of the most
common joint problems seen with an arthroscope are:
• inflammation in the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or ankle
• injuries to the shoulder (rotator cuff tendon tears,
impingement syndrome, and recurrent dislocations),
knee (cartilage tears, wearing down of or injury to the
cartilage cushion, and anterior cruciate ligament tears
with instability), and wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome)
• loose bodies of bone and/or cartilage in the knee, shoul-
der, elbow, ankle, or wrist

instruments that are inserted through additional inci-
sions. Arthritis can sometimes be treated with arthro-
scopic surgery. Some problems are treated with a combi-
nation of arthroscopic and standard surgery.
Also called arthroscopy, the procedure is per-
formed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility. The
type of anesthesia (local, spinal, or general) and the
length of the procedure depends on the joint operated on
and the complexity of the suspected problem. Arthro-
scopic surgery rarely takes more than an hour. Most
patients who have arthroscopic surgery are released that
same day; some patients stay in the hospital overnight.
Considered the most important orthopedic develop-
ment in the 20th century, arthroscopic surgery is widely
used. The use of arthroscopic surgery on famous athletes
has been well publicized. It is estimated that 80% of
orthopedic surgeons practice arthroscopic surgery.
Arthroscopic surgery was initially a diagnostic tool used
prior to open surgery, but as better instruments and tech-
niques were developed, it began to be used to actually
treat a variety of joint problems. New techniques current-
ly under development are likely to lead to other joints
being treated with arthroscopic surgery in the future.
Recently, lasers were introduced in arthroscopic surgery
and other new energy sources are being explored. Lasers
and electromagnetic radiation can repair rather than resect
injuries and may be more cost effective than instruments.
Preparation
Before the procedure, blood and urine studies and x
rays of the joint will be conducted.
Aftercare
Immediately after the procedure, the patient will
spend several hours in the recovery room. An ice pack
will be put on the joint that was operated on for up to 48
hours after the procedure. Painmedicine, prescription or
non-prescription, will be given. The morning after the
surgery, the dressing can be removed and replaced by
adhesive strips. The patient should call his/her doctor
upon experiencing an increase in pain, swelling, redness,
drainage or bleeding at the site of the surgery, signs of
infection (headache, muscle aches,dizziness,fever), or
nausea or vomiting.

Arthroscopy
Definition
Arthroscopy is the examination of a joint, specifical-
ly, the inside structures. The procedure is performed by
inserting a specifically designed illuminated device into
the joint through a small incision. This instrument is
called an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy is
primarily associated with the process of diagnosis. How-
ever, when actual repair is performed, the procedure is
called arthroscopic surgery.
Purpose
Arthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special-
ize in treating disorders of the bones and related structures
(orthopedics) to help diagnose joint problems. Once
described as essential for those who primarily care for ath-
letic injuries, arthroscopy is now a technique commonly
used by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients of
all ages. This procedure is most commonly used to diagnose
knee and shoulder problems, although the elbow, hip, wrist,
and ankle may also be examined with an arthroscope.
A joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligaments
attach bones to other bones, tendons attach muscles to
bones, cartilage lines and helps protect the ends of bones,
and a special fluid (synovial fluid) cushions and lubricates
the structures. Looking inside the joint allows the doctors
to see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopy
also permits earlier diagnosis of many types of joint prob-
lems which had been difficult to detect in previous years.
Precautions
Most arthroscopic procedures today are performed
in same-day surgery centers where the patient is admitted
just before surgery. A few hours following the procedure,
the patient is allowed to return home, although usually
someone else must drive. Depending on the type of anes-
thesia used, the patient may be told not to eat for several
hours before arriving. Before the procedure, the anesthe-
siologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies
to local or general anesthetics. Airway obstruction is
always possible in any patient who receives a general

toring equipment must be available. The patient’s cardiac
status should always be monitored in the event that any
cardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy.
Description
The arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct-
ly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses and glass-
coated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint. A
camera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon to
see a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans-
ferred to a monitor located in the operating room at the
time of the arthroscopy. This video technology is also
important for documentation of the arthroscopic proce-
dure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthro-
scopic examination that a conventional approach to sur-
gically expose or “open” the joint (arthrotomy) must be
used, a good photographic record will be useful when the
surgeon returns to execute the final surgical plan.
The procedure requires the surgeon to make several
small incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface into
the joint. Through one or two of the portals, a large-bore
needle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and inserted
into the joint. The joint is inflated with a sterile saline
solution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopic
viewing. Often, following a recent traumatic injury to a
joint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte-
rior viewing of the joint difficult. In this condition, a con-
stant flow of the saline solution is necessary. This inflow
of saline solution may be through the cannula with the
outflow through the arthroscope, or the positions may be
reversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of the
portals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint.
Preparation
Before an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeon
completes a thorough medical history and evaluation.
Important for the accuracy of this diagnostic procedure, a

Arthroscopy is primarily used to help diagnose joint problems. This procedure, most commonly associated with knee and
shoulder problems, allows accurate examination and diagnosis of damaged joint ligaments, surfaces, and other related joint
structures. The illustration above indicates the most common entry sites, or portals, in knee arthroscopy.(Illustration by Elec-
tronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 365  medical history and evaluation may discover other disor-
ders of the joint or body parts, proving the procedure
unnecessary. This is always an important preliminary step,
because paincan often be referred to a joint from another
area of the body. Anatomical models and pictures are use-
ful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopy
and what the surgeon may be looking at specifically.
Proper draping of the body part is important to pre-
vent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopy,
such as the camera, light cords, and inflow and outflow
drains placed in the portals. Draping packs used in
arthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapes
with adhesive backing. The surgeon may also place a
tourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flow
to the area during the arthroscopic exam.
General or local anesthesia may be used during
arthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used because it
reduces the risk of lung and heart complications and
allows the patient to go home sooner. The local anesthet-
ic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locations
in skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration. In
other cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord
or a main nerve supplying the area. This process is called
a “block,” and it blocks all sensation below the main
trunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral block anes-
thetizes the leg from the thigh down (its name comes
from femur, the thighbone). Most patients are comfort-
able once the skin, muscles, and other tissues around the
joint are numbed by the anesthetic; however, some
patients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety
about the procedure. (It’s important for the patient to
remain still during the arthroscopic examination.)
General anesthesia, in which the patient becomes
unconcious, may be used if the procedure may be unusu-
ally complicated or painful. For example, people who
have relatively “tight” joints may be candidates for gen-
eral anesthesia because the procedure may take longer
and cause more discomfort.
Aftercare
The portals are closed by small tape strips or stitches
and covered with dressings and a bandage. The patient
spends a short amount of time in the recovery room after
arthroscopy. Most patients can go home after about an
hour in the recovery room. Pain medication may be pre-
scribed for a short period; however, many patients find
various over-the-counter pain relievers sufficient.
Following the surgical procedure, the patient needs
to be aware of the signs of infection, which include red-
ness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling. The risk of
infection increases if the incisions become wet too early
following surgery. Because of this, it is good practice to
cover the joint with plastic (for example, a plastic bag)
while showering after arthroscopy.
The use of crutches is commonplace after arthro-
scopy, with progression to independent walking on an “as
tolerated” basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitation
program, supervised by a physical therapist, follows short-
ly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobility
and strength of the affected joint and limb.
Risks
The incidence of complications is low compared to
the high number of arthroscopic procedures performed
every year. Possible complications include infection,
swelling, damage to the tissues in the joint, blood clots in
the leg veins (thrombophlebitis), leakage of blood into
the joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that move to the lung
(pulmonary embolus), and injury to the nerves around
the joint.
Normal results
The goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint prob-
lem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal joint func-
tion. For example, arthroscopy can be a useful tool in
locating a tear in the joint surface of the knee or locating
a torn ligament of the shoulder. Arthroscopic examina-
tion is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performed
to repair the problem with appropriate arthroscopic tools.
The final result is to decrease pain, increase joint mobili-
ty, and thereby improve the overall quality of the
patient’s activities of daily living.
Abnormal results
Less optimal results that may require further treat-
ment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, the
joint capsule that naturally forms around the joint
becomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in a
stiff and less mobile joint. This problem is frequently
corrected by manipulation and mobilization of the joint
with the patient placed under general anesthesia.

Art therapy
Definition
Art therapy, sometimes called creative arts therapy
or expressive arts therapy, encourages people to express
and understand emotions through artistic expression and
through the creative process.
Purpose
Art therapy provides the client-artist with critical
insight into emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Key bene-
fits of the art therapy process include:
• Self-discovery. At its most successful, art therapy trig-
gers an emotional catharsis.
KEY TERMS
Hemarthrosis—A condition of blood within a
joint.
Pulmonary embolus—Blockage of an artery of the
lung by foreign matter such as fat, tumor, tissue, or
a clot originating from a vein.
Thrombophlebitis—Inflamation of a vein with the
formation of a thrombus or clot.
• Personal fulfillment. The creation of a tangible reward
can build confidence and nurture feelings of self-worth.
Personal fulfillment comes from both the creative and
the analytical components of the artistic process.
• Empowerment. Art therapy can help people visually
express emotions and fears that they cannot express
through conventional means, and can give them some
sense of control over these feelings.
• Relaxation and stressrelief. Chronic stress can be
harmful to both mind and body. Stress can weaken and
damage the immune system, can cause insomniaand
depression, and can trigger circulatory problems (like
high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats). When
used alone or in combination with other relaxation
techniques such as guided imagery, art therapy can
effectively relieve stress.
• Symptom relief and physical rehabilitation. Art thera-
py can also help patients cope with pain. This therapy
can promote physiological healing when patients iden-
tify and work through anger, resentment, and other
emotional stressors. It is often prescribed to accompany
pain control therapy for chronically and terminally ill
patients.
Description
Origins
Humans have expressed themselves with symbols
throughout history. Masks, ritual pottery, costumes, other
objects used in rituals, cave drawings, Egyptian hiero-
glyphics, and Celtic art and symbols are all visual
records of self-expression and communication through
art. Art has also been associated spiritual power, and
artistic forms such as the Hindu and Buddhist mandala
and Native American sand painting are considered pow-
erful healing tools.
In the late nineteenth century, French psychiatrists
Ambrose Tardieu and Paul-Max Simon both published
studies on the similar characteristics of and symbolism in
the artwork of the mentally ill. Tardieu and Simon
viewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to iden-
tify specific types of mental illness or traumatic events.
Later, psychologists would use this diagnostic aspect to
develop psychological drawing tests (the Draw-A-Man
test, the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) and
projective personality tests involving visual symbol
recognition (e.g., the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the The-
matic Apperception Test[TAT], and the Holtzman
Inkblot Test [HIT]).
The growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy-
chiatric institutions in the twentieth century was an
important factor in the development of art therapy in the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	367
Art therapy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 367  United States. Milieu therapies (or environmental thera-
py) focus on putting the patient in a controlled therapeu-
tic social setting that provides the patient with opportuni-
ties to gain self-confidence and interact with peers in a
positive way. Activities that encourage self-discovery
and empowerment such as art, music, dance, and writing
are important components of this approach.
Educator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was a
follower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated art into
psychotherapy as a means for her patients to visualize and
recognize the unconscious. She founded the Walden
School in 1915, where she used students’ artworks in psy-
chological counseling. She published extensively on the
subject and taught seminars on the technique at New York
University in the 1950s. Today, she is considered the
founder of art therapy in the United States.
In the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger
introduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-based
psychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men-
ninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residence
in the following years, and the facility was also consid-
ered a leader in the art therapy movement through the
1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers who
emerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, Hanna
Yaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental Health),
and Janie Rhyne.
Art therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art
psychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional
growth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre-
ation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted in
Freud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious and
unconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption that
visual symbols and images are the most accessible and
natural form of communication to the human experience.
Patients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, the
thoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. The
resulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter-
preted by the patient.
The “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera-
py typically allows patients to gain some level of insight
into their feelings and lets them to work through these
issues in a constructive manner. Art therapy is typically
practiced with individual, group, or family psychothera-
py (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide critical
guidance for these activities, a key feature of effective art
therapy is that the patient/artist, not the therapist, directs
the interpretation of the artwork.
Art therapy can be a particularly useful treatment
tool for children, who frequently have limited language
skills. By drawing or using other visual means to express
troublesome feelings, younger patients can begin to
address these issues, even if they cannot identify or label
these emotions with words. Art therapy is also valuable
for adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling to
talk about thoughts and feelings.
Beyond its use in mental health treatment, art thera-
py is also used with traditional medicine to treat organic
diseases and conditions. The connection between mental
and physical health is well documented, and art therapy
can promote healing by relieving stress and allowing the
patient to develop coping skills.
Art therapy has traditionally centered on visual
mediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Some
mental healthcare providers have now broadened the def-
inition to include music, film, dance, writing, and other
types of artistic expression.
Art therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatient
or outpatient treatment program, and can take place in
individual or group therapysessions. Group art therapy
sessions often take place in hospital, clinic, shelter, and
community program settings. These group therapy ses-
sions can have the added benefits of positive social inter-
action, empathy, and support from peers. The client-artist
can learn that others have similar concerns and issues.
Preparations
Before starting art therapy, the therapist may have an
introductory session with the client-artist to discuss art
therapy techniques and give the client the opportunity to
ask questions about the process. The client-artist’s comfort
with the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.
The therapist ensures that appropriate materials and
space are available for the client-artist, as well as an ade-
quate amount of time for the session. If the individual
artist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of a
trained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time are
still important factors in a successful creative experience.
The supplies used in art therapy are limited only by
the artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of the
materials often used include paper, canvas, poster board,
assorted paints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks,
fabrics, string, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bend-
able metals, and natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.).
Providing artists with a variety of materials in assorted
colors and textures can enhance their interest in the
process and may result in a richer, more diverse explo-
ration of their emotions in the resulting artwork. Appro-
priate tools such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, sup-
ply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaning
materials are also essential.
An appropriate workspace should be available for
the creation of art. Ideally, this should be a bright, quiet,
comfortable place, with large tables, counters, or other
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2368
Art therapy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 368  suitable surfaces. The space can be as simple as a kitchen
or office table, or as fancy as a specialized artist’s studio.
The artist should have adequate time to become
comfortable with and explore the creative process. This
is especially true for people who do not consider them-
selves “artists” and may be uncomfortable with the con-
cept. If performed in a therapy group or one-on-one ses-
sion, the art therapist should be available to answer gen-
eral questions about materials and/or the creative
process. However, the therapist should be careful not to
influence the creation or interpretation of the work.
Precautions
Art materials and techniques should match the age
and ability of the client. People with impairments, such
as traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological con-
dition, may have difficulties with the self-discovery por-
tion of the art therapy process depending on their level of
functioning. However, they may still benefit from art
therapy through the sensory stimulation it provides and
the pleasure they get from artistic creation.
While art is accessible to all (with or without a ther-
apist to guide the process), it may be difficult to tap the
full potential of the interpretive part of art therapy with-
out a therapist to guide the process. When art therapy is
chosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical con-
dition, it should be treated as a supplemental therapy and
not as a substitute for conventional medical treatments.
Research and general acceptance
A wide body of literature supports the use of art
therapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mind-
body connection between psychological well-being and
physical health is further documented by studies in the
field, art therapy gains greater acceptance by mainstream
medicine as a therapeutic technique for organic illness.

Asbestosis
Definition
Asbestosis is chronic, progressive inflammation of
the lung. It is not contagious.
Description
Asbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposure
to large quantities of asbestos, a material once widely
used in construction, insulation, and manufacturing.
When asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the breathing
passages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar lung tissue. In
advanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink, stiffen, and
become honeycombed (riddled with tiny holes).
Legislation has reduced use of asbestos in the United
States, but workers who handle automobile brake shoe
linings, boiler insulation, ceiling acoustic tiles, electrical
equipment, and fire-resistant materials are still exposed
to the substance. Asbestos is used in the production of
paints and plastics. Significant amounts can be released
into the atmosphere when old buildings or boats are
razed or remodeled.
Asbestosis is most common in men over 40 who
have worked in asbestos-related occupations. Smokers or
heavy drinkers have the greatest risk of developing this
disease. Between 1968 and 1992, more than 10,000
Americans over the age of 15 died as a result of asbesto-
sis. Nearly 25% of those who died lived in California or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	369
Asbestosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 369  New Jersey, and most of them had worked in the con-
struction or shipbuilding trades.
Causes and symptoms
Occupational exposure is the most common cause of
asbestosis, but the condition also strikes people who
inhale asbestos fiber or who are exposed to waste prod-
ucts from plants near their homes. Family members can
develop the disease as a result of inhaling particles of
asbestos dust that cling to workers’ clothes.
It is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone who
hasn’t been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on a
regular basis for at least 10 years. Symptoms of the dis-
ease do not usually appear until 15–20 years after initial
exposure to asbestos.
The first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness
of breathfollowing exerciseor other physical activity.
The early stages of the disease are also characterized by a
dry coughand a generalized feeling of illness.
As the disease progresses and lung damage increas-
es, shortness of breath occurs even when the patient is at
rest. Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing up
blood are common. So is swelling of the feet, ankles, or
hands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis include
chest pain, hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients who
have asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thick-
ened) fingers. Other potential complications include
heart failure, collapsed (deflated) lung, and pleurisy
(inflammation of the membrane that protects the lung).
Diagnosis
Screening of at-risk workers can reveal lung inflamma-
tion and lesions characteristic of asbestosis. Patients’ med-
ical histories can identify occupations, hobbies, or other sit-
uations likely to involve exposure to asbestos fibers.
X rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs or an
indistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that suggests the
presence of asbestosis. Blood tests are used to measure
concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary
function tests can be used to assess a patient’s ability to
inhale and exhale, and a computed tomography scan
(CT) of the lungs can show flat, raised patches associated
with advanced asbestosis.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help patients breathe
more easily, prevent colds and other respiratory infec-
tions, and control complications associated with
advanced disease. Ultrasonic, cool-mist humidifiers or
controlled coughing can loosen bronchial secretions.
Regular exercise helps maintain and improve lung
capacity. Although temporary bed rest may be recom-
mended, patients are encouraged to resume their regular
activities as soon as they can.
Antibioticsmay be prescribed to combat infection.
Aspirinor acetominophen (Tylenol) can relieve minor
discomfort and bronchodilatorsthat are swallowed or
inhaled can relax and widen breathing passages.
Diuretics(drugs that increase urine production and
excretion) or digitalis glycoside (Digitalis purpurea) are
prescribed for some patients. Others may need to use
supplemental oxygen or use less salt.
Anyone who develops symptoms of asbestosis
should see a family physician or lung disease specialist.
A doctor should be notified if someone who has been
diagnosed with asbestosis:
• coughs up blood
• continues to lose weight
• is short of breath
• has chest pain
• develops a sudden feverof 101°F (38.3°C) or higher
• develops unfamiliar, unexplained symptoms
Prognosis
Asbestosis can’t be cured, but its symptoms can be
controlled. Doctors don’t know why the health of some
patients deteriorates and the condition of others remain
the same, but believe the difference may be due to vary-
ing exposures of asbestos. People with asbestosis who
smoke, particularly those who smoke more than one
pack of cigarettes each day, are at increased risk for

to quit smoking.
Prevention
Workers in asbestosis-related industries should have
regular x rays to determine whether their lungs are
healthy. A person whose lung x ray shows a shadow
should eliminate asbestos exposure even if no symptoms
of the condition have appeared.
Anyone who works with asbestos should wear a pro-
tective mask or a hood with a clean-air supply and obey
recommended procedures to control asbestos dust. Any-
one who is at risk of developing asbestosis should:
• not smoke
• be vaccinated against influenzaand pneumonia
• exercise regularly to maintain cardiopulmonary fitness
• avoid crowds and people who have respiratory infec-
tions
A person who has asbestosis should exercise regu-
larly, relax, and conserve energy whenever necessary.

Ascites
Definition
Ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the
abdomen.
Description
Rapidly developing (acute) ascites can occur as a
complication of trauma, perforated ulcer,appendicitis,
or inflammation of the colon or other tube-shaped organ
(diverticulitis). This condition can also develop when
intestinal fluids, bile, pancreatic juices, or bacteria
invade or inflame the smooth, transparent membrane that
lines the inside of the abdomen (peritoneum). However,
ascites is more often associated with liver disease and
other long-lasting (chronic) conditions.
Types of ascites
Cirrhosis, which is responsible for 80% of all
instances of ascites in the United States, triggers a series
of disease-producing changes that weaken the kidney’s
ability to excrete sodium in the urine.
Pancreatic ascites develops when a cyst that has
thick, fibrous walls (pseudocyst) bursts and permits pan-
creatic juices to enter the abdominal cavity.
Chylous ascites has a milky appearance caused by
lymph that has leaked into the abdominal cavity.
Although chylous ascites is sometimes caused by trau-
ma, abdominal surgery,tuberculosis, or another peri-
toneal infection, it is usually a symptom of lymphoma or
some other cancer.
Cancer causes 10% of all instances of ascites in the
United States. It is most commonly a consequence of dis-
ease that originates in the peritoneum (peritoneal carci-
nomatosis) or of cancer that spreads (metastasizes) from
another part of the body.
Endocrine and renal ascites are rare disorders.
Endocrine ascites, sometimes a symptom of an endocrine
system disorder, also affects women who are taking fer-
tility drugs. Renal ascites develops when blood levels of
albumin dip below normal. Albumin is the major protein

Ascites

blood vessels.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
The two most important factors in the production of
ascites due to chronic liver disease are:
• Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a change
in the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchange
(osmotic pressure). This change in pressure allows fluid
to seep out of the blood vessels.
• An increase in the pressure within the branches of the
portal vein that run through liver (portal hypertension).
Portal hypertension is caused by the scarring that
occurs in cirrhosis. Blood that cannot flow through the
liver because of the increased pressure leaks into the
abdomen and causes ascites.
Other conditions that contribute to ascites develop-
ment include:
• hepatitis
• heart or kidney failure
• inflammation and fibrous hardening of the sac that con-
tains the heart (constrictive pericarditis)
Persons who have systemic lupus erythematosus
but do not have liver disease or portal hypertension occa-
sionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid activity
sometimes causes pronounced ascites, but inflammation
of the pancreas (pancreatitis) rarely causes significant
accumulations of fluid.
Symptoms
Small amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not usual-
ly produce symptoms. Massive accumulations may cause:
• rapid weight gain
• abdominal discomfort and distention
• shortness of breath
• swollen ankles
Diagnosis
Skin stretches tightly across an abdomen that con-
tains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies flat,
and the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor taps the
abdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks to bulge.
Physical examinationgenerally enables doctors to
distinguish ascites from pregnancy, intestinal gas,obe-
sity, or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog-
raphy scans(CT) can detect even small amounts of
fluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by inserting
a needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic para-
centesis) can help identify the cause of the accumulation.
Treatment
Reclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneys
absorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest and a
low-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs (diuretics) may be
prescribed if initial treatment is ineffective. The weight
and urinary output of patients using diuretics must be
carefully monitored for signs of :
• hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid)
• azotemia (abnormally high blood levels of nitrogen-
bearing materials)
• potassium imbalance
• high sodium concentration. If the patient consumes
more salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses of
diuretics should be prescribed
Moderate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are treat-
ed by draining large amounts of fluid (large-volume
paracentesis) from the patient’s abdomen. This procedure
is safer than diuretic therapy. It causes fewer complica-
tions and requires a shorter hospital stay.
Large-volume paracentesis is also the preferred
treatment for massive ascites. Diuretics are sometimes

dure may be repeated periodically.
Alternative treatment
Dietary alterations, focused on reducing salt intake,
should be a part of the treatment. In less severe cases,
herbal diuretics like dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) can
help eliminate excess fluid and provide potassium. Potas-
sium-rich foods like low-fat yogurt, mackerel, cantaloupe,
and baked potatoes help balance excess sodium intake.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends upon the condition that is
causing the ascites. Carcinomatous ascites has a very bad
prognosis. However, salt restriction and diuretics can
control ascites caused by liver disease in many cases.
Therapy should also be directed towards the under-
lying disease that produces the ascites. Cirrhosis should
be treated by abstinence from alcohol and appropriate
diet. The new interferon agents maybe helpful in treating
chronic hepatitis.
Prevention
Modifying or restricting use of salt can prevent most
cases of recurrent ascites.

Aspartate aminotransferase test
Definition
The Aspartate aminotransferase test measures levels
of AST, an enzyme released into the blood when certain
organs or tissues, particularly the liver and heart, are
injured. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known
as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT).
Purpose
The determination of AST levels aids primarily in
the diagnosis of liver disease. In the past, the AST test
was used to diagnose heart attack(myocardial infarc-
tion or MI) but more accurate blood tests have largely
replaced it for cardiac purposes.
Description
AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample,
usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the bend
of the elbow.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	373
Aspartate aminotransferase test
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 373  AST is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, pancreas, spleen, lung, red blood cells, and brain
tissue. When disease or injury affects these tissues, the
cells are destroyed and AST is released into the blood-
stream. The amount of AST is directly related to the
number of cells affected by the disease or injury, but the
level of elevation depends on the length of time that the
blood is tested after the injury. Serum AST levels
become elevated eight hours after cell injury, peak at 24-
36 hours, and return to normal in three to seven days. If
the cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels will
remain elevated.
One of the most important uses for AST determina-
tion has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart attack,
or MI. AST can assist in determining the timing and
extent of a recent MI, although it is less specific than cre-
atine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB, myglobin, tro-
ponins, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Assuming no
further cardiac injury occurs, the AST level rises within
6-10 hours after an acute attack, peaks at 12-48 hours,
and returns to normal in three to four days. Myocardial
injuries such as angina(chest pain) or pericarditis
(inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane around
the heart) do not increase AST levels.
AST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liver
disease. Although not specific for liver disease, it can
be used in combination with other enzymes to monitor
the course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silent
hepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of elevat-
ed AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessive
alcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderately
elevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise to
over 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside the
liver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levels
that can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then rapid-
ly fall. In cases of cirrhosis, the AST level is related to
the amount of active inflammation of the liver. Determi-
nation of AST also assists in early recognition of toxic
hepatitis that results from exposure to drugs toxic to the
liver, like acetaminophenand cholesterol lowering
medications.
Other disorders or diseases in which the AST deter-
mination can be valuable include acute pancreatitis,
muscle disease, trauma, severe burn, and infectious
mononucleosis.
Preparation
The physician may require discontinuation of any
drugs that might affect the test. These types include such
drugs as antihypertensives (for treatment of high blood
pressure), coumarin-type anticoagulants (blood-thinning
drugs), digitalis, erythromycin (an antibiotic),oral con-

traceptives, and opiates, among others. The patient may
also need to cut back on strenuous activities temporarily,
because exercisecan also elevate AST for a day or two.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,faintingor
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal ranges for the AST are laboratory-specific,
but can range from 3-45 units/L (units per liter).
Abnormal results
Striking elevations of AST (400-4000 units/L) are
found in almost all forms of acute hepatic necrosis, such
as viral hepatitis and carbon tetrachloride poisoning. In
alcoholics, even moderate doses of the analgesic aceta-
minophen have caused extreme elevations (1,960-29,700
units/L). Moderate rises of AST are seen in jaundice,
cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma. Approximately 80%
of patients with infectious mononucleosis show eleva-
tions in the range of 100-600 units/L.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 374  Aspergillosis
Definition
Aspergillosis refers to several forms of disease
caused by a fungus in the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillo-
sis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal, eyes,
nose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some individuals, the
infection can even invade bone and the membranes that
enclose the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
Description
Aspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs
caused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungus
Aspergillus. Spores are the small particles that most
fungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone is
exposed to this fungus in their daily environment, it
rarely causes disease. When Aspergillusdoes cause dis-
ease, however, it usually occurs in those individuals with
weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) or
who have a history of respiratory ailments. Because it
does not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis is
generally thought to be underdiagnosed and underre-
ported. Furthermore, many patients with the more severe
forms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple, complex
health problems, such as AIDSor a blood disorder like
leukemia, which can further complicate diagnosis and
treatment.
Once considered particularly rare, the incidence of
reported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the devel-
opment of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis and
advances made in other areas of medicine, such as with
the increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corti-
costeroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating vari-
ous types of cancerbut that decrease the individual’s
immune response, making them more susceptible to
other diseases like aspergillosis.
Our advanced ability to perform tissue and organ
transplants has also increased the number of people vul-
nerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients, partic-
ularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplants,
are highly susceptible to Aspergillus, which may be cir-
culating in the hospital air.
Aspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadly
threat for two primary reasons:
• Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who
are already ill or have weakened immune systems, such
as patients who have undergone chemotherapyfor
cancer.
• None of the currently available antifungal drugs are
reliably effective against Aspergillus.
Causes and symptoms
Aspergillusis a fungus that is found almost everywhere,
but particularly in soil, water, decaying vegetation, and
stored grain. The fungus has also been cultured from ventila-
tion systems and may be stirred up during building renova-
tions. The species most commonly identified in patients with
confirmed disease are A. fumigatusand A. flavus.
Airborne Aspergillusspores enter the body primarily
through inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eye.
Normally functioning immune systems are generally able
to cope without consequent development of aspergillosis.
It is important to make distinctions between the vari-
ous forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and prognosis
varies considerably among types. Aspergillosis as a diag-
nosis refers to three general forms:
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is
seen in patients with long-standing asthma, particular-
ly in patients taking oral corticosteroidsfor a long
period of time. This is usually the least serious and
most treatable form.
• Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal
spores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that have
been pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosisor
prior pneumonia. There are several available treatments,
although the success rate varies with each treatment.
• Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which
the fungus spreads throughout the body via the blood
stream and invades other organ systems. Once estab-
lished, invasive fungal infections are extremely difficult
to cure and, as a result, the associated deathrate is
extremely high.
Aspergillusinfection of the ear (called otomycosis),
can produce itchingand a discharge, sometimes noticed
as a spot on the pillow. Fungal infection of the cornea of
the eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness, if
not diagnosed and treated promptly.
Diagnosis
Aspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose
because the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing,
if present at all, are common to many respiratory disor-
ders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures are not
very helpful. The presence of Aspergillusis so common,
even in asthmatics, that a positive culture alone is insuffi-
cient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially more useful,
screening tools include examining the sample obtained
after repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lung
with water (bronchial lavage), but examining a tissue
sample (biopsy) is the most reliable diagnostic tool.
Researchers are currently attempting to develop a practi-

Aspergillosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 375  cal, specific, and rapid blood test that would confirm
Aspergillusinfection.
Signs of ABPA include a worsening of bronchial
asthma accompanied by a low-grade fever. Brown flecks
or clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary func-
tion tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting an
obstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels of an
antibody produced in response to Aspergillusand of cer-
tain immune system cells may indicate a specific aller-
gic-type immune system response.
A fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually
does not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag-
nosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or more
of patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemoptysis) at
least once, and this may become repetitive and serious.
Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that the patient
may be suffering from an aspergilloma.
In patients with lowered immune systems who are at
risk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physician
may use a combination of blood culturewith visual diag-
nostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans
(CT) and radiography, to arrive at a likely diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment method selected depends on the form
of aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated with many
of the same drugs used to treat asthma, such as systemic
steroids. Long-term therapy may be required, however, to
prevent recurrence. Antifungal agents are not recom-
mended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo-
ma, it may become necessary to surgically remove or
reduce the size of a fungal mass, especially if the patient
continues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affecting
the nose and nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.
In non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs may
be indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone)
is the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will depend
on the patient’s condition but usually begins with a small
test dose and then escalates. Less than one-third of
patients are likely to respond to amphotericin B, and its
side effects often limit its use. For patients who do not
respond to oral amphotericin B, another option is a dif-
ferent formulation of the same drug called liposomal
amphotericin B.
For patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler-
ate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole
(Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also been
approved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months. Giv-
ing itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if pre-
scribed in combination with certain other drugs by
increasing the concentrations of both drugs in the blood
and creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Even
antacidscan significantly affect itraconazole levels. As a
result, drug levels must be continually monitored to
ensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels.
Two other methods of treatment are being studied:
direct instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungs
and administration of antifungals using a nebulizer.
Instilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazole
directly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ball
(aspergilloma) itself has been helpful in stopping
episodes of hemoptysis, but not in preventing future
recurrences. Furthermore, many patients with aspergillo-
mas are poor risks for surgery because their lung func-
tion is already compromised. As a result, instillation of a
fungal agent should only be considered in those who
have significant hempotysis.
A popular method of treating some respiratory dis-
orders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid and
aerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled into
the lungs through a device called a nebulizer. However,
this has not yet been shown to improve the patient’s con-
dition in cases of aspergillosis, possibly because the drug
is not reaching the aspergilloma.
At this point, preventative therapy for aspergillosis is
not suggested for susceptible individuals, primarily
because overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal infec-
tions may lead to the development of drug-resistant

tion of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus.(Illustra-

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 376  aspergillosis against which current antifungal drugs are
no longer effective.
Prognosis
The likelihood of recovery from aspergillosis depends
on any underlying medical conditions, the patient’s gener-
al health, and the specific type of aspergillosis. If the prob-
lem is based on an allergic response, as in ABPA, the
patient will likely respond well to systemic steroids.
Patients who require lung surgery, especially those
who have problems with coughing up blood, have a mortal-
ity rate of about 7-14%, and complications or recurrence
may result in a higher overall death rate. However, by treat-
ing aspergilloma with other, non-surgical methods, that risk
rises to 26%, making surgery a better option in some cases.
Unfortunately, the prognosis for the most serious
form, invasive aspergillosis, is quite poor, largely because
these patients have little resilience due to their underlying
disorders. Death rates have ranged from about 50% in
some studies to as high as 95% for bone-marrow recipients
and patients with AIDS. The course of the illness can be
rapid, resulting in death within a few months of diagnosis.
Prevention
Fungal infection by Aspergilluspresents a major
challenge, particularly in the patient with a suppressed
immune system (immunocompromised). Hospitals and
government health agencies continually seek ways to
minimize exposure for hospitalized patients. Practical
suggestions are minimal but include moving leaf piles
away from the house. Unfortunately, overall avoidance of
this fungus is all but impossible because it is present in
the environment virtually everywhere. Research efforts
are being directed at enhancing patients’ resistance to
Aspergillusrather than trying to eliminate exposure to
the fungus. Given the growing number of people with
immune disorders or whose immune systems have been
suppressed in the course of treating another disease,
research and clinical trials for new antifungal agents will
be increasingly important in the future.

Aspirin
Definition
Aspirin is a medicine that relieves painand reduces
fever.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	377
Aspirin
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 377  Purpose
Aspirin is used to relieve many kinds of minor aches
and pains—headaches, toothaches, muscle pain, men-
strual cramps, the joint pain from arthritis, and aches
associated with colds and flu. Some people take aspirin
daily to reduce the risk of stroke,heart attack, or other
heart problems.
Description
Aspirin—also known as acetylsalicylic acid—is sold
over the counter and comes in many forms, from the
familiar white tablets to chewing gum and rectal supposi-
tories. Coated, chewable, buffered, and extended release
forms are available. Many other over-the-counter medi-
cine contain aspirin. Alka-Seltzer Original Effervescent
Antacid Pain Reliever, for example, contains aspirin for
pain relief and sodium bicarbonate to relieve acid indi-
gestion,heartburn, and sour stomach.
Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicy-
lates. Other members of this group include sodium salicy-
late, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. These
drugs are more expensive and no more effective than
aspirin. However, they are a little easier on the stomach.
Aspirin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and pro-
vides quick and relatively long-lasting pain relief. Aspirin
also reduces inflammation. Researchers believe these
effects come about because aspirin blocks the production
of pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins.
In addition to relieving pain and reducing inflamma-
tion, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part of the
brain that regulates temperature. The brain then signals
the blood vessels to widen, which allows heat to leave
the body more quickly.
Recommended dosage
Adults
TO RELIEVE PAIN OR REDUCE FEVER. one to two
tablets every three to four hours, up to six times per day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF STROKE. one tablet four
times a day or two tablets twice a day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK.Check with
a physician for the proper dose and number of times per
week aspirin should, if at all, be taken.
Children
Check with a physician.
Precautions
Aspirin—even children’s aspirin—should never be
given to children or teenagers with flu-like symptoms or
chickenpox. Aspirin can cause Reye’s syndrome, a life-
threatening condition that affects the nervous system and
liver. As many as 30% of children and teenagers who
develop Reye’s syndrome die. Those who survive may
have permanent brain damage.
Check with a physician before giving aspirin to a
child under 12 years for arthritis, rheumatism, or any
condition that requires long-term use of the drug.
No one should take aspirin for more than 10 days in
a row unless told to do so by a physician. Anyone with
fever should not take aspirin for more than 3 days with-
out a physician’s consent. Do not to take more than the
recommended daily dosage.
People in the following categories should not use
aspirin without first checking with their physician:
• Pregnant women. Aspirin can cause bleeding problems
in both the mother and the developing fetus. Aspirin
can also cause the infant’s weight to be too low at birth.
• Women who are breastfeeding. Aspirin can pass into
breast milk and may affect the baby.
• People with a history of bleeding problems.
• People who are taking blood-thinning drugs, such as
warfarin (Coumadin).
• People with a history of ulcers.
• People with a history of asthma,nasal polyps, or both.
These people are more likely to be allergic to aspirin.
• People who are allergic to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indo-
methacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamate sodium, naprox-
en, sulindac, tolmetin, or the orange food-coloring tar-
trazine. They may also be allergic to aspirin.
• People with AIDSor AIDS-related complex who are
taking AZT (zidovudine). Aspirin can increase the risk
of bleeding in these patients.
• People taking certain other drugs (discussed in Interac-
tions).
• People with liver damage or severe kidney failure.
Aspirin should not be taken before surgery, as it can
increase the risk of excessive bleeding. Anyone who is
scheduled for surgery should check with his or her sur-
geon to find out how long before surgery to avoid taking
aspirin.
Aspirin can cause stomach irritation. To reduce the
likelihood of that problem, take aspirin with food or milk
or drink a full 8-oz glass of water with it. Taking coated
or buffered aspirin can also help. Be aware that drinking
alcohol can make the stomach irritation worse.
Stop taking aspirin immediately and call a physician
if any of these symptoms develop:
• ringing or buzzing in the ears

•dizziness
• stomach pain that does not go away
Do not take aspirin that has a vinegary smell. That is
a sign that the aspirin is too old and ineffective. Flush
such aspirin down the toilet.
Because aspirin can increase the risk of excessive
bleeding, do not take aspirin daily over long periods—to
reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack, for example—
unless advised to do so by a physician.
Side effects
The most common side effects include stomachache,
heartburn, loss of appetite, and small amounts of blood in
KEY TERMS
Diuretic—Medicine that increases the amount of
urine produced and relieves excess fluid buildup
in body tissues. Diuretics may be used in treating
high blood pressure, lung disease, premenstrual
syndrome, and other conditions.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
NSAIDs—Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Drugs such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen which
relieve pain and reduce inflammation.
Polyp—A lump of tissue protruding from the lining
of an organ, such as the nose, bladder, or intes-
tine. Polyps can sometimes block the passages in
which they are found.
Prostaglandin—A hormonelike chemical produced
in the body. Prostaglandins have a wide variety of
effects, and may be responsible for the production
of some types of pain and inflammation.
Reye’s syndrome—A life-threatening disease that
affects the liver and the brain and sometimes
occurs after a viral infection, such as flu or chick-
enpox. Children or teenagers who are given
aspirin for flu or chickenpox are at increased risk
of developing Reye’s syndrome.
Rhinitis—Inflammation of the membranes inside
the nose.
Salicylates—A group of drugs that includes aspirin
and related compounds. Salicylates are used to
relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.
stools. Less common side effects are rashes,hives, fever,
vision problems, liver damage, thirst, stomach ulcers,
and bleeding. People who are allergic to aspirin or those
who have asthma,rhinitis, or polyps in the nose may
have trouble breathing after taking aspirin.
Interactions
Aspirin may increase, decrease, or change the
effects of many drugs. Aspirin can make drugs such as
methotrexate (Rheumatrex) and valproic acid (Depakote,
Depakene) more toxic. If taken with blood-thinning
drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and dicumarol,
aspirin can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.
Aspirin counteracts the effects of other drugs, such as
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
beta blockers, which lower blood pressure, and medi-
cines used to treat gout(probenecid and sulfinpyrazone).
Blood pressure may drop unexpectedly and cause faint-

Asthma
Definition
Today asthma is viewed as a chronic (long-lasting)
inflammatory disease of the airways. In those susceptible
to asthma, this inflammation causes the airways to nar-
row periodically. This, in turn, produces wheezingand
breathlessness, sometimes to the point where the patient
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	379
Asthma

neously or responds to a wide range of treatments, but
continuing inflammation makes the airways hyper-
responsive to stimuli such as cold air,exercise, dust
mites, pollutants in the air, and even stressand anxiety.
Description
About 10 million Americans have asthma, and the
number seems to be increasing. Between 1982-92, the
rate actually rose by 42%. Not only is asthma becoming
more frequent, but it also is a more severe disease than
before, despite modern drug treatments. In the same 10-
year period, the deathrate from asthma in the United
States increased by 35%.
The changes that take place in the lungs of asth-
matic persons makes the airways (the “breathing tubes,”
or bronchiand the smaller bronchioles) hyper-reactive
to many different types of stimuli that don’t affect
healthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle tissue in
the walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the cells lining
the airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spaces.
Both these actions cause the bronchi to become nar-
rowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result, an asthmatic
person has to make a much greater effort to breathe in
air and to expel it.
Cells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells,
release certain substances that cause the bronchial mus-
cle to contract and stimulate mucus formation. These
substances, which include histamine and a group of
chemicals called leukotrienes, also bring white blood
cells into the area, which is a key part of the inflammato-
ry response. Many patients with asthma are prone to
react to such “foreign” substances as pollen, house dust
mites, or animal dander; these are called allergens. On
the other hand, asthma affects many patients who are not
“allergic” in this way.
Asthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence,
but it also may first appear during adult years. While the
symptoms may be similar, certain important aspects of
asthma are different in children and adults.
Child-onset asthma
When asthma does begin in childhood, it often does
so in a child who is likely, for genetic reasons, to become
sensitized to common “allergens” in the environment
(atopic person). When these children are exposed to
house-dust mites, animal proteins, fungi, or other poten-
tial allergens, they produce a type of antibody that is
intended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials. This
has the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to par-
ticular materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to an
asthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present in
at least one-third and as many as half of the general pop-
ulation. When an infant or young child wheezes during
viral infections, the presence of allergy (in the child itself
or a close relative) is a clue that asthma may well contin-
ue throughout childhood.
Adult-onset asthma
Allergenic materials may also play a role when
adults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start at
any age and in a wide variety of situations. Many adults
who are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis
or nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to aspirinand
related drugs. Another major source of adult asthma is
exposure at work to animal products, certain forms of
plastic, wood dust, or metals.
Causes and symptoms
In most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller-
gen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissue
changes leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon-
striction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at least
minimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat-
ing asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irritant
is causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once asthma
is present, symptoms can be set off or made worse if the
patient also has rhinitis(inflammation of the lining of
the nose) or sinusitis. When, for some reason, stomach
acid passes back up the esophagus (acid reflux), this can
also make asthma worse. A viral infection of the respira-
tory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin
and a type of drug called beta-blockers, often used to
treat high blood pressure, can also worsen the symptoms
of asthma.
The most important inhaled allergens giving rise to
attacks of asthma are:
• animal dander
• mites in house dust
• fungi (molds) that grow indoors
• cockroach allergens
• pollen
• occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles
of industrial materials in the air
Inhaling tobacco smoke, either by smokingor being
near people who are smoking, can irritate the airways
and trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollutants can have a
similar effect. In addition, there are three important fac-
tors that regularly produce attacks in certain asthmatic
patients, and they may sometimes be the sole cause of
symptoms. They are:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2380
Asthma
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 380  • inhaling cold air (cold-induced asthma)
• exercise-induced asthma (in certain children, asthma is
caused simply by exercising)
• stress or a high level of anxiety
Wheezing is often very obvious, but mild asthmatic
attacks may be confirmed when the physician listens to
the patient’s chest with a stethoscope. Besides wheezing
and being short of breath, the patient may coughand
may report a feeling of “tightness” in the chest. Children
may have itchingon their back or neck at the start of an
attack. Wheezing is often loudest when the patient
breathes out, in an attempt to expel used air through the
narrowed airways. Some asthmatics are free of symp-
toms most of the time but may occasionally be short of
breath for a brief time. Others spend much of their days
(and nights) coughing and wheezing, until properly treat-
ed. Crying or even laughing may bring on an attack.
Severe episodes are often seen when the patient gets a
viral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavy
load of an allergen or irritant. Asthmatic attacks may last
only a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (a
condition called status asthmaticus).
Being short of breath may cause a patient to become
very anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and use the mus-
cles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe. The
patient may be able to say only a few words at a time
before stopping to take a breath. Confusion and a bluish
tint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is much
too low, and that emergency treatment is needed. In a
severe attack that lasts for some time, some of the air
sacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects within
the chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in enough
air. Almost always, even patients with the most severe
attacks will recover completely.
Diagnosis
Apart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam-
iner should look for maximum chest expansion while
taking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neck
muscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasal
polyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are often
noted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like atopic
dermatitisor eczema, are a tipoff that the patient has
allergic problems.
Inquiring about a family history of asthma or aller-
giescan be a valuable indicator of asthma. The diagnosis
may be strongly suggested when typical symptoms and
signs are present. A test called spirometry measures how
rapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in the
lungs. Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drug
that widens the air passages (a bronchodilator) will show
whether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is a
very typical finding in asthma. Often patients use a relat-
ed instrument, called a peak flow meter, to keep track of
asthma severity when at home.
Often, it is difficult to determine what is triggering
asthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,
although an allergic skin response does not always mean
that the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also,
the body’s immune system produces antibody to fight off
the allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea-
sured by a blood test. This will show how sensitive the
patient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is still
in doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen while
using a spirometer to detect airway narrowing. Spirome-
try can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exer-
cise-induced asthma is a possibility. A chest x raywill
help rule out other disorders.
Treatment
Patients should be periodically examined and have
their lung function measured by spirometry to make sure
that treatment goals are being met. These goals are to pre-
vent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function as
close to normal as possible, and to allow patients to pur-
sue their normal activities including those requiring exer-
tion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmat-
ic symptoms while causing few or no side-effects.
Drugs
METHYLXANTHINES.The chief methylxanthine drug
is theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatory
effect, and is especially helpful in controlling nighttime
symptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patient
cannot use an inhaler to maintain long-term control, sus-
tained-release theophylline is a good alternative. The
blood levels of the drug must be measured periodically,
as too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm or
convulsions.
BETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS.These drugs, which are
bronchodilators, are the best choice for relieving sudden
attacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from being
triggered by exercise. Some agonists, such as albuterol,
act mainly in lung cells and have little effect on other
organs, such as the heart. These drugs generally start act-
ing within minutes, but their effects last only four to six
hours (although longer-acting forms are being devel-
oped). They may be taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.
STEROIDS.These drugs, which resemble natural
body hormones, block inflammation and are extremely
effective in relieving symptoms of asthma. When
steroids are taken by inhalation for a long period, asthma
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	381
Asthma
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 381  attacks become less frequent as the airways become less
sensitive to allergens. This is the strongest medicine for
asthma, and can control even severe cases over the long
term and maintain good lung function. Steroids can
cause numerous side-effects, however, including bleed-
ing from the stomach, loss of calcium from bones,
cataractsin the eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients
using steroids for lengthy periods may also have prob-
lems with wound healing, may gain weight, and may suf-
fer mental problems. In children, growth may be slowed.
Besides being inhaled, steroids may be taken by mouth
or injected, to rapidly control severe asthma.
LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. Leukotriene modifiers
are a new type of drug that can be used in place of
steroids, for older children or adults who have a mild
degree of asthma that persists. They work by counteract-
ing leukotrienes, which are substances released by white
blood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to con-
strict and promote mucus secretion.
OTHER DRUGS.Cromolyn and nedocromil are anti-
inflammatory drugs that are often used as initial treatment
to prevent asthmatic attacks over the long term in children.
They can also prevent attacks when given before exercise
or when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided. These
are safe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken regular-
ly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cholinergic drugs,
such as atropine, are useful in controlling severe attacks
when added to an inhaled beta-receptor agonist. They help
widen the airways and suppress mucus production.
If a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that
cannot be avoided and it has been difficult to control
symptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth try-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2382
Asthma
In normal bronchioles the airway
is open and unobstructed.
During an attack, the bronchioles of an
asthma sufferer are constricted by bands
of muscle around them. They may be
further obstructed by increased mucus
production and tissue inflammation.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 382  ing. Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen are
injected over a period of three to five years, so that the
body can build up an effective immune response. There
is a risk that this treatment may itself cause the airways
to become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attack.
Not all experts are enthusiastic about immunotherapy,
although some studies have shown that it does reduce
asthmatic symptoms caused by exposure to house-dust
mites, ragweed pollen, and cats.
Managing asthmatic attacks
A severe asthma attack should be treated as quickly
as possible. It is most important for a patient suffering an
acute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may be
necessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help the
patient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeat-
edly or continuously. If the patient does not respond
promptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course of
steroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make a
recurrence less likely.
Maintaining control
Long-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling a
beta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters the
dose. Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhaler
to be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug. Once
asthma has been controlled for several weeks or months, it
is worth trying to cut down on drug treatment, but this must
be done gradually. The last drug added should be the first to
be reduced. Patients should be seen every one to six
months, depending on the frequency of attacks.
Starting treatment at home, rather than in hospital,
makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain a
sense of control over the disease. All patients should be
taught how to monitor their symptoms so that they will
know when an attack is starting, and those with moderate
or severe asthma should know how to use a flow meter.
They should also have a written “action plan” to follow if
symptoms suddenly become worse, including how to
adjust their medication and when to seek medical help. If
more intense treatment is necessary, it should be contin-
ued for several days. Over-the-counter “remedies” should
be avoided. When deciding whether a patient should be
hospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity of
symptoms, current medication, and whether good support
is available at home all must be taken into account.
Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered if:
• there has been a life-threatening asthma attack or
severe, persistent asthma
• treatment for three to six months has not met its goals
• some other condition, such as nasal polyps or chronic
lung disease, is complicating asthma
• special tests, such as allergy skin testing or an allergen
challenge, are needed
• intensive steroid therapy has been necessary
Special populations
INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especially
important to closely watch the course of asthma in young
patients. Treatment is cut down when possible and if
there is no clear improvement, some other treatment
should be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe asth-
matic symptoms, steroids may help. The health care
provider should write out an asthma treatment plan for
the child’s school. Asthmatic children often need med-
ication at school to control acute symptoms or to prevent
exercise- induced attacks. Proper management will usu-
ally allow a child to take part in play activities. Only as a
last resort should activities be limited.
THE ELDERLY.Older persons often have other types of
obstructive lung disease, such as chronic bronchitisor
emphysema. This makes it important to know to what
extent the symptoms are caused by asthma. Giving steroids
for two to three weeks can help determine this. Side-effects
from beta-receptor agonist drugs (including a speeding
heart and tremor) may be more common in older patients.
These patients may benefit from receiving an anti-choliner-
gic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theo-
phylline is given, the dose should be limited, as older
patients are less able to clear this drug from their blood.
Steroids should be avoided, as they often make elderly
patients confused and agitated. Steroids may also further
weaken the bones.
Prognosis
Most patients with asthma respond well when the
best drug or combination of drugs is found, and they are
able to lead relatively normal lives. More than half of
affected children stop having attacks by the time they
reach 21 years of age. Many others have less frequent
and less severe attacks as they grow older. Urgent mea-
sures to control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment to
prevent attacks are equally important. A small minority
of patients will have progressively more trouble breath-
ing and they run a risk of going into respiratory failure
and they must receive intensive treatment.
Prevention
Minimizing exposure to allergens
There are a number of ways to cut down exposure to
the common allergens and irritants that provoke asthmat-
ic attacks, or to avoid them altogether:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	383
Asthma
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 383  • If the patient is sensitive to a family pet, remove the
animal or at least keep it out of the bedroom (with the
bedroom door closed). Keep the pet away from carpets
and upholstered furniture. Remove all feathers.
• To reduce exposure to house dust mites, remove wall-
to-wall carpeting, keep the humidity down, and use spe-
cial pillow and mattress covers. Cut down on stuffed
toys, and wash them each week in hot water.
• If cockroach allergen is causing asthma attacks, kill the
roaches (using poison, traps, or boric acid rather than
chemicals). Take care not to leave food or garbage
exposed.
• Keep indoor air clean by vacuuming carpets once or
twice a week (with the patient absent), avoid using
humidifiers, and do use air conditioning during warm
weather (so that the windows can be closed).
• Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.
• Do not exercise outside when air pollution levels are
high.
• When asthma is related to exposure at work, take all
precautions, including wearing a mask and, if neces-
sary, arrange to work in a safer area.

Astigmatism
Definition
Astigmatism is the result of an inability of the
cornea to properly focus an image onto the retina. The
result is a blurred image.
Description
The cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a
transparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye
(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps to
focus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photo
receptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses via
the optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.
The cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of the
cornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light that
passes through that part of the cornea. The bending of
light is called refraction and focusing problems with the
cornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive dis-
orders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that results
from an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the cornea is
spherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in astigma-
tism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a foot-
ball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.
These two meridians generally have a constant curvature
and are generally perpendicular to each other (regular
astigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more than
two meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart. A
point of light, therefore, going through an astigmatic
cornea will have two points of focus, instead of one nice
sharp image on the retina. This will cause the person to
have blurry vision. What the blur looks like will depend
upon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism. A
person with nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2384
Astigmatism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 384  (hyperopia) may see a dot as a blurred circle. A person
with astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred oval
or frankfurter-shaped blur.
Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problems
in the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature of
the lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism
(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea is
usually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the
least amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase
during childhood, as the eye is developing.
Causes and symptoms
The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo-
ple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parents
can notice that a child may have astigmatism when the
child can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear-
ly than others. For example, lines going across may seem
clearer than lines going up and down.
Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of
the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion,
surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or scarring to the
cornea, the presence of tumors in the eyelid, or a develop-
mental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar-
ring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in which
the cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usually
occurs around pubertyand is more common in women.
Although the causes of keratoconus are unknown, it may
be hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in peo-
ple with allergies. The center of the cone may not be in
line with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a role
in the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar lev-
els can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye. This
process usually occurs slowly and, often, is only noticed
when the diabetic has started treatment to control their
blood sugar. The return to a more normal blood sugar
allows the lens to return to normal and this change is
sometimes noticed by the patient as farsightedness.
Because of this, diabetics should wait until their blood
sugar is under control for at least one month to allow
vision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses.
Diagnosis
Patients seek treatment because of blurred vision. A
variety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism during
the eye exam. The patient may be asked to describe the
astigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward from
a center. People with astigmatism will see some of the
lines more clearly than others. One diagnostic instrument
used is the keratometer. This measures the curvature of
the central cornea. It measures the amount and direction
of the curvature. A corneal topographer can measure a
larger area of the cornea. It can measure the central area
and mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projects
a series of concentric light rings onto the cornea. Mis-
shapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areas
of the light pattern that do not appear concentric on the
cornea. Because these instruments are measuring the
cornea, it is also important to have a refraction in case the
lens is also contributing to the astigmatism. The refrac-
tion measures the optics or visual status of the eye and
the result is the eyeglass prescription. The refraction is
when the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctor
is putting different lenses in front of the patient’s eyes
and asks which one looks better.
Treatment
Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical
lenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses. The
unit of measure describing the power of the lens system or
lens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are shaped to
counteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are caus-
ing the difficulty. Because the correction is in one direction,
it is written in terms of the axis the correction is in. On a
prescription, for example, it may say -1.00D 180°.

myopia, and plus spheres correct hyperopia.
There is some debate as to whether people with very
small amounts of astigmatism should be treated. Gener-
ally, if visual acuity is good and the patient experiences
no overt symptoms, treatment is not necessary. When
treating larger amounts of astigmatism, or astigmatism
for the first time, the doctor may not totally correct the
astigmatism. The cylindrical correction in the eyeglasses
may make the floor appear to tilt, thus making it difficult
for the patient at first. Generally, the doctor will place
lenses in a trial frame to allow the patient to try the pre-
scription at the exam. It may take a week or so to get
used to the glasses, however, if the patient is having a
problem they should contact their doctor, who might
want to recheck the prescription.
Contact lenses that are used to correct astigmatism
are called toric lenses. When a person blinks, the contact
lens rotates. In toric lenses, it is important for the lens to
return to the same position each time. Lenses have thin
zones, or cut-off areas (truncated), or have other ways to
rotate and return to the correct position. Soft toric lenses
are available in a variety of prescriptions, materials, and
even in tints. Patients should ask their doctors about the
possibility of toric lenses.
In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved laser treatment of astigmatism. Patients consid-
ering this should make sure the surgeon has a lot of expe-
rience in the procedure and discuss the possible side
effects or risks with the doctor. In the case of kerato-
conus, a corneal transplant is performed if the astigma-
tism can not be corrected with hard contact lenses.
Prognosis
Astigmatism is a condition that may be present at
birth. It may also be acquired if something is distorting the
cornea. Vision can generally be corrected with eyeglasses

Aston-Patterning
Definition
Aston-Patterning is an integrated system of move-
ment education, bodywork, ergonomic adjustments, and
fitness training that recognizes the relationship between
the body and mind for well being. It helps people who
seek a remedy from acute or chronic painby teaching
them to improve postural and movement patterns.
Purpose
Aston-Patterning assists people in finding more effi-
cient and less stressful ways of performing the simple
movements of everyday life to dissipate tension in the
body. This is done through massage, alteration of the
environment, and fitness training.
Description
Seeking to solve movement problems, Aston-Pat-
terning helps make the most of their own unique body
types rather than trying to force them to conform to an
ideal. Unlike Rolfing, it doesn’t strive for linear symme-
try. Rather it works with asymmetry in the human body
to develop patterns of alignment and movement that feel
right to the individual. Aston also introduced the idea of
working in a three-dimensional spinal pattern.
Aston-Patterning sessions have four general compo-
nents. They are:
• A personal history that helps the practitioner assess the
client’s needs.
• Pre-testing, in which the practitioner and the client explore
patterns of movement and potential for improvement.

sage, myofacial release, and arthrokinetics, to help
release tension and make new movement patterns easier.
• Post-testing, when pre-testing movements are repeated,
allowing the client to feel the changes that have taken
place and integrate them into daily life.
Aston-Patterning requires more participation from
the client than many bodywork techniques. The massage
aspect of Aston-Patterning is designed around a three-
dimensional, non-compressive touch that releases pat-
terns of tension in the body. It is gentler than Rolfing.
Myokinetics uses touch to release tension in the face and
neck. Arthrokinetics addresses tension at bones and
joints. This massage is accompanied by education about
how new movement patterns may be established.
In addition to Aston-Patterning sessions, clients are
also helped to examine their environment for factors, such
as seating or sleeping arrangements, that may limit their
body function and introduce tension. Finally, they may
choose to participate in the Aston fitness training program
that includes loosening techniques based on self-massage,
toning, stretching, and cardiovascular fitness.
KEY TERMS
Rolfing—Developed by Dr. Ida Rolf (1896–1979),
rolfing is a systematic approach to relieving stress
patterns and dysfunctions in the body’s structure
through the manipulation of the highly pliant myofa-
cial (connective) tissue. It assists the body in reorga-
nizing its major segments into vertical alignment.
Preparations
No special preparation need be taken.
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary when partici-
pating.
Side effects
No undesirable side effects are reported. Usually
clients report a diminution of tension, improved body
movement, and an enhanced feeling of well being.
Research and general acceptance
Aston-Patterning is an outgrowth of Rolfing, which
has been shown to be of benefit in a limited number of
controlled studies. Little controlled research has been done
on the either benefits or limitations of Aston-Patterning. Its
claims have been neither proven nor disproved, although
anecdotally many clients report relief from pain and ten-
sion and also improved body movement.

JUDITH ASTON
Judith Aston was born in Long Beach, California.
She graduated from University of California at Los Ange-
les with a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest in
movement arose from working as a dancer. In 1963
Aston established her first movement education pro-
gram for dancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach
City College.
Five years later, while recovering from injuries sus-
tained during two consecutive automobile accidents,
Aston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Aston
began working for Rolf, teaching a movement education
program called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that
emphasized using the body with minimum effort and
maximum precision.
In time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement
diverged, and the partnership was dissolved in 1977.
Aston formed her own company called the Aston Para-
digm Corporation in Lake Tahoe, California. This com-
pany provides training and certification for Aston practi-
tioners. She also began exploring how environmental
conditions affect body movement, foreshadowing the
ergonomic movement in the workplace that developed
in the 1990s. Over time, Aston has expanded her move-
ment work to include a fitness program for older adults.
Today, Judith Aston serves as director of Aston Paradigm
Corporation.

area of the brain, leading to a lack of balance and coordina-
tion. A-T also affects the immune system and increases the
risk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals.
Description
The disorder first appeared in the medical literature in
the mid-1920s, but was not named specifically until 1957.
The name is a combination of two recognized abnormali-
ties: ataxia (lack of muscle control) and telangiectasia
(abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result in
tumors and red skin lesions). However, A-T involves more
than just the sum of these two findings. Other associated
A-T problems include immune system deficiencies,
extreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers.
Medical researchers initially suspected that multiple
genes (the units responsible for inherited features) were
involved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single large
gene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers named
the gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent research
revealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating cell
division. The symptoms associated with A-T reflect the
main role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu-
lar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damaged
DNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutated
into ATM, the signaling networks are affected and the cell
no longer responds correctly to minimize the damage.
A-T is very rare, but it occurs in every population
world wide, with an estimated frequency of between
1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it is believed that
many A-T cases, particularly those who die at a young
age, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this disease
may actually be much more prevalent. According to the
A-T Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million in
the United States) of the general population carries defec-
tive A-T genes. Carriers of one copy of this gene do not
develop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk of
cancer. This makes the A-T gene one of the most impor-
tant cancer-related genes identified to date.
Causes and symptoms
The ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning the
disease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited from
both parents. Infants with A-T initially often appear very
healthy. At around age two, ataxia and nervous system
abnormalities becomes apparent. The root cause of A-T-
associated ataxia is cell deathin the brain, specifically
the large branching cells of the nervous system (Purkin-
je’s cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddler
becomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks muscle
control. Speech becomes slurred and more difficult, and
the symptoms progressively worsen. Between ages two
and eight, telangiectases, or tiny, red “spider” veins,
appear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes.
By age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer control
their muscles. Immune system deficiencies become com-
mon, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive to
radiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between indi-
viduals but include lower-than-normal levels of proteins
that function as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and white
blood cells (blood cells not containing “iron” proteins). The
thymus gland, which aids in development of the body’s
immune system, is either missing or has developed abnor-
mally. Intelligence is normal, but growth may be retarded
owing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies. Indi-
viduals with A-T are also sometimes afflicted with dia-
betes, prematurely graying hair, and difficulty swallowing.
As the children grow older, the immune system becomes
weaker and less capable of fighting infection. In the later
stages, recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancers,
such as leukemia or lymphoma, are common.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A-
T: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia. However, this
may be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior to
telangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symp-
toms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% of
individuals with A-T have a high incidence of respiratory
infection, 30% do not. The identification of the ATM
gene raises hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment,
may be possible.
Treatment
There is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment
focuses on managing the individual’s multiple symp-
toms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help the
patient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, or
extracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are used
to strengthen the weakened immune system. High-dose
vitamin administrations may also be prescribed.
Research continues in many countries to find effective
treatments. Individuals and families living with this dis-
order may benefit from attending support groups.
Prognosis
A-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T become
physically disabled by their early teens and typically die
by their early 20s, usually from the associated blood can-
cers and malignancies. In very rare cases, individuals
with A-T may experience slower progression and a
slightly longer life span, surviving into their 30s. A-T
carriers have a five-fold higher risk than non-carriers of
developing certain cancers, especially breast cancer.

Medical researchers are investigating methods for
screening individuals who may be carriers of the defec-
tive gene. Prenatal testing for A-T is possible but not
done routinely, because commercial screening tests have
yet to be developed.

Atelectasis
Definition
Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue affecting part
or all of one lung. This condition prevents normal oxy-
gen absoption to healthy tissues.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	389
Atelectasis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 389  Description
Atelectasis can result from an obstruction (block-
age) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called alve-
oli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a rich blood
supply. They are important for lung function, since their
purpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
When the airways are blocked by a mucous “plug,” for-
eign object, or tumor, the alveoli are unable to fill with
air and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affected
area. Atelectasis is a potential complication following
surgery, especially in individuals who have undergone
chest or abdominal operations resulting in associated
abdominal or chest painduring breathing. Congenital
atelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs to
expand at birth. This congenital condition may be local-
ized or may affect all of both lungs.
Causes and symptoms
Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attemps at
respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, or
absence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveoli
that maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing the
surface tension of fluids that coat the lung). This lack of
surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective
gas exchange causing it to collapse if severe. Pressure on
the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as
obstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resulting
from various infections and lung diseases. Tumors and
inhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway,
leading to atelectasis.
Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery
using general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis,
since breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoid
pain from the surgical incision. Any significant decrease
in airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre-
tions, which in turn can cause infection. Chest injuries
causing shallow breathing, including fractured ribs, can
cause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasis
include shortness of breathand decreased chest wall
expansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of the
lung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the condition
affects a large area of the lung and develops quickly, the
individual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extreme
shortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on the
affected side. Feverand increased heart rate may be pre-
sent if infection accompanies atelectasis.
Diagnosis
To diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recording
the patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys-
ical examination. When the doctor listens to the lungs
through a stethoscope (ausculation), diminished or
bronchial breath sounds may be heard. By tapping on the
chest (percussion) while listening through the stetho-
scope, the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed. A
chest x raythat shows an airless area in the lung con-
firms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If an obstruction of the
airways is suspected, a computed tomography scan (CT)
or bronchoscopymay be performed to locate the cause
of the blockage.
Treatment
If atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway, the
first step in treatment is to remove the cause of the block-
age. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bron-
choscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgery
may be necessary to remove it. Antibioticsare commonly
used to fight the infection that often accompanies atelec-
tasis. In cases where recurrent or long-lasting infection is
disabling or where significant bleeding occurs, the affect-
ed section of the lung may be surgically removed.
Prognosis
If atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus “plug” or
inhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com-
pletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by a
tumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumor
involved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-oper-
ative conditions and/or complications affect the prognosis.

When recovering from surgery, frequent reposi-
tioning in bed along with coughing and deep breathing
are important. Coughing and breathing deeply every
one to two hours after any surgical operation with gen-
eral anesthesia is recommended. Breathing exercises
and the use of breathing devices, such as an incentive
spirometer, may also help prevent atelectasis.
Although smokers have a higher risk of developing
atelectasis following surgery, stopping smokingsix to
eight weeks before surgery can help reduce the risk.
Increasing fluid intake during respiratory illness or
after surgery (by mouth or intravenously) helps lung
secretions to remain loose. Increasing humidity may
also be beneficial.
Postural drainage techniques can be learned from a
respiratory therapist or physical therapist and are a useful
tool for anyone affected with a respiratiory illness that
could cause atelectasis. Because foreign objectsblock-
ing the airway can cause atelectasis, it is very important
to keep small objects that might be inhaled away from
young children.

Atherectomy
Definition
Atherectomy is a non-surgical procedure to open
blocked coronary arteries or vein grafts by using a device
on the end of a catheter to cut or shave away atheroscle-
rotic plaque (a deposit of fat and other substances that
accumulate in the lining of the artery wall).
Purpose
Atherectomy is performed to restore the flow of
oxygen-rich blood to the heart, to relieve chest pain, and
to prevent heart attacks. It may be done on patients with
chest pain who have not responded to other medical ther-
apy and on certain of those who are candidates for bal-
loon angioplasty(a surgical procedure in which a bal-
loon catheter is used to flatten plaque against an artery
wall) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	391
Atherectomy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 391  sometimes performed to remove plaque that has built up
after a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Precautions
Atherectomy should not be performed when the
plaque is located where blood vessels divide into branch-
es, when plaque is angular or inside an angle of a blood
vessel, on patients with weak vessel walls, on ulcerated
or calcium-hardened lesions, or on blockages through
which a guide wire won’t pass.
Description
Atherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other device
placed on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroy
plaque. At the beginning of the procedure, medications to
control blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries, and
prevent blood clots are administered. The patient is
awake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an artery
in the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through the blood
vessels into the blocked coronary artery. The cutting
head is positioned against the plaque and activated, and
the plaque is ground up or suctioned out.
The types of atherectomy are rotational, directional,
and transluminal extraction. Rotational atherectomy uses a
high speed rotating shaver to grind up plaque. Directional
atherectomy was the first type approved, but is no longer
commonly used; it scrapes plaque into an opening in one
side of the catheter. Transluminal extraction coronary
atherectomy uses a device that cuts plaque off vessel walls
and vacuums it into a bottle. It is used to clear bypass grafts.
Performed in a cardiac catheterizationlab, atherec-
tomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronary
arteries. It can be used instead of, or along with, balloon
angioplasty. Atherectomy is successful about 95% of the
time. Plaque forms again in 20-30% of patients.
Preparation
The day before atherectomy, the patient takes med-
ication to prevent blood clots and may be asked to bathe
and shampoo with an antiseptic skin cleaner.
Aftercare
After the procedure, the patient spends several days
in the hospital’s cardiac monitoring area. For at least 20

site. For the first hour, an electrocardiogram and close
monitoring are conducted; vital signs are checked every
15 minutes. Pain medication is then administered. The
puncture site is checked once an hour or more. For most
of the first 24 hours, the patient remains in bed.
Risks
Chest pain is the most common complication of
atherectomy. Other common complications are injury to
the blood vessel lining, plaque that re-forms, blood clots
(hematoma), and bleeding at the site of insertion. More
serious but less frequent complications are blood vessel
holes, blood vessel wall tears, or reduced blood flow to
the heart.

Atherosclerosis
Definition
Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque on
the inside of blood vessels. In Greek,atheremeans gruel,
and sklerosmeans hard.Atherosclerosis is often called
arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria,
meaning artery) is a general term for hardening of the
arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms,
including atherosclerosis.
Description
Atherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible
for most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis or
hardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of several
layers: an inner lining called the endothelium, an elastic
membrane that allows the artery to expand and contract,
a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of connective tis-
sue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hard-
ening of the inner and middle layers of the artery. It can
be caused by normal aging, by high blood pressure, and
by diseases such as diabetes. Atherosclerosis is a type of
arteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of an
artery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that block
the flow of blood.
Plaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,
waste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a
stringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque forma-
tion process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to pro-
duce substances that accumulate in the inner layer. Fat
builds up within these cells and around them, and they
form connective tissue and calcium. The inner layer of
the artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter is reduced,
and blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreased.
Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing the sudden
formation of a blood clot (thrombosis). Atherosclerosis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	393
Atherosclerosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 393  can cause a heart attackif it completely blocks the
blood flow in the heart (coronary) arteries. It can cause a
strokeif it completely blocks the brain (carotid) arteries.
Atherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neck,
kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing kidney failure or gan-
greneand amputation.
Causes and symptoms
Atherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it
usually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some people
experience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis during
their thirties, others during their fifties or sixties. Athero-
sclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still unknown. It is
thought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response to
damage to the endothelium from high cholesterol, high
blood pressure, and cigarette smoking. A person who has
all three of these risk factors is eight times more likely to
develop atherosclerosis than is a person who has none.
Physical inactivity, diabetes, and obesityare also risk
factors for atherosclerosis. High levels of the amino acid
homocysteine and abnormal levels of protein-coated fats
called lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary artery
disease. These substances are the targets of much current
research. The role of triglycerides, another fat that circu-
lates in the blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques is
unclear. High levels of triglycerides are often associated
with diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-density
lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (“good”)
cholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary artery
disease. These risk factors are all modifiable. Non-modi-
fiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.
Risk factors that can be changed:
• Cigarette/tobacco smoke—Smoking increases both the
chance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance of
dying from coronary heart disease. Second hand smoke
may also increase risk.
• High blood cholesterol—Cholesterol, a soft, waxy sub-
stance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs, and other
animal products and is produced in the liver. Age, sex,
heredity, and diet affect cholesterol. Total blood choles-
terol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL and
borderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-
density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159
mg/dL.
• High triglycerides—Most fat in food and in the body
takes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride lev-
els above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronary
artery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however,
are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.
• High blood pressure—Blood pressure of 140 over 90 or
higher makes the heart work harder, and over time, both
weakens the heart and harms the arteries.
• Physical inactivity—Lack of exerciseincreases the risk
of atherosclerosis.
• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing atheroscle-
rosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be
lowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most dia-
betics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.
• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the
heart and increases the risk of developing atherosclero-
sis even if no other risk factors are present.
Risk factors that cannot be changed:
• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery
disease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are at
increased risk. The high rate of severe hypertension
among African-Americans puts them at increased risk.
• Sex—Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart
attacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is equal
among men and women.
• Age—Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and
older and women who are 55 years of age and older.
Symptoms differ depending upon the location of the
atherosclerosis.
• In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart attack,
or sudden death.
• In the carotid (brain) arteries: Sudden dizziness, weak-
ness, loss of speech, or blindness.
• In the femoral (leg) arteries: Disease of the blood ves-
sels in the outer parts of the body (peripheral vascular
disease) causes cramping and fatiguein the calves
when walking.
• In the renal (kidney) arteries: High blood pressure that
is difficult to treat.
Diagnosis
Physicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero-
sclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stetho-
scope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand (pal-
pation). More definite tests are electrocardiography,
echocardiographyor ultrasonography of the arteries (for
example, the carotids), radionuclide scans, and angiogra-
phy.
An electrocardiogram shows the heart’s activity. Elec-
trodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the
patient’s body. They send impulses of the heart to a
recorder. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed
in a physician’s office. Exercise electrocardiography (stress
test) is conducted while the patient exercises on a treadmill

an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes.
Echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, uses sound
waves to create an image of the heart’s chambers and
valves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transduc-
er, presses it against the patient’s chest, and images are
displayed on a monitor. This technique cannot evaluate
the coronary arteries directly. They are too small and are
in motion with the heart. Severe coronary artery disease,
however, may cause abnormal heart motion that is
detected by echocardiography. Performed in a cardiology
outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30-60
minutes. Ultrasonography is also used to assess arteries
of the neck and thighs.
Radionuclide angiography and thallium (or ses-
tamibi) scanning enable physicians to see the blood flow
through the coronary arteries and the heart chambers.
Radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream. A
device that uses gamma rays to produce an image of the
radioactive material (gamma camera) records pictures of
the heart. Radionuclide angiography is usually performed
in a hospital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30-
60 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done after an
exercise stresstest or after injection of a vasodilator, a
drug to enlarge the blood vessels, like dipyridamole (Per-
santine). Thallium is injected, and the scan is done then
and again four hours (and possibly 24 hours) later. Thalli-
um scanning is usually performed in a hospital’s nuclear
medicine department. Each scan takes 30-60 minutes.

Atherosclerosis
The result is a fibrous 
lesion, made up in part
of muscle cells, proteins, 
and collagen, that has at 
its center a pool of lipids 
and dead cells. Blood 
flow can be very nearly 
cut off by the blockage.
When the arterial lining becomes 
separated over the growing mass of 
foam cells, platelets are attracted to the 
site and begin the process of clot formation.
Platelets
High cholesterol levels, 
high blood pressure, 
diabetes, obesity, viruses,
cigarette smoking, etc., 
cause injuries to the 
lining of the artery, 
creating areas where 
higher levels of lipids
are trapped.
Further injury is inflicted by foam cells
attempting to remove lipids back to the
lungs, liver, spleen and lymph nodes
by again passing through the lining of
the artery.
MonocyteLining of
artery
Muscle
T-cell
Monocytes (the largest of the 
white blood cells) and T-cells 
are attracted to the injury.
Foam cell
Monocytes, which become 
macrophages when they leave 
the bloodstream, and T-cells 
penetrate the lining of the artery.
The macrophages soak up lipids, 
becoming large foam cells and 
distorting the inner surface of the 
artery. Blood flow becomes
restricted.
The progression of atherosclerosis.(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 395  Coronary angiography is the most accurate diagnos-
tic method and the only one that requires entering the
body (invasive procedure). A cardiologist inserts a
catheter equipped with a viewing device into a blood ves-
sel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart. The
patient has been given a contrast dye that makes the heart
visible to x rays. Motion pictures are taken of the con-
trast dye flowing though the arteries. Plaques and block-
ages, if present, are well defined. The patient is awake
but has been given a sedative. Coronary angiography is
performed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory and
takes from 30 minutes to two hours.
Treatment
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering
drugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,
and coronary artery bypass surgery. Atherosclerosis
requires lifelong care.
Patients who have less severe atherosclerosis may
achieve adequate control through lifestyle changes and
drug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent
disease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, los-
ing weight (if necessary), exercise, controlling blood
pressure, and not smoking—also help prevent the disease.
Most of the drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis seek
to lower cholesterol. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs
can reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average of 25-30%
when combined with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.
Lipid-lowering drugs include bile acid resins, “statins”
(drugs that effect HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme that
controls the processing of cholesterol), niacin, and fibric
acid derivatives such as gemfibrozil (Lobid). Aspirin
helps prevent thrombosis and a variety of other medica-
tions can be used to treat the effects of atherosclerosis.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
bypass surgery are invasive procedures that improve
blood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous translu-
minal coronary angioplasty (coronary angioplasty) is a
non-surgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with a
balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into
the blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compresses the
plaque to enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blocked
artery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiolo-
gist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital stay of
one or two days. It is successful about 90% of the time,
but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again with-
in six months. It can be repeated and a “stent” may be
placed in the artery to help keep it open (see below).
In coronary artery bypass surgery (bypass surgery),
a detour is built around the blockage with a healthy vein
or artery, which then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the
heart. It is major surgery appropriate for patients with
blockages in two or three major coronary arteries or
severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and for
those who have not responded to other treatments. It is
performed in a hospital under general anesthesia and
uses a heart-lung machine. About 70% of patients experi-
ence full relief; about 20% partial relief.
Three other semi-experimental surgical procedures
may be used to treat atherosclerosis. In atherectomy,a
cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from
the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a
laser tip is inserted to burn or break down the plaque. A
metal coil called a stent may be permanently implanted
to keep a blocked artery open.
Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies that focus on diet and lifestyle
can help prevent, retard, or reverse atherosclerosis. Herbal
therapies that may be helpful include: hawthorn (Cratae-
gus laevigata), notoginseng root (Panax notoginseng),
garlic (Allium sativum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), hot
red or chili peppers, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and
alfalfa (Medicago sativum). Relaxation techniques
including yoga,meditation,guided imagery,biofeed-
back, and counseling and other “talking” therapies may
also be useful to prevent or slow the progress of the dis-
ease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that are
low in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar,
and animal proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants
(found in fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use of
onions and garlic is recommended, as is eating raw and
cooked fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon.
Smoking, alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should be
avoided. Chelation therapy, which uses anticoagulant
drugs and nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it through
the kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can be
prescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine, which
combines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise,
and homeopathy, which treats a disease with small doses
of a drug that causes the symptoms of the disease.
Prognosis
Atherosclerosis can be successfully treated but not
cured. Recent clinical studies have shown that athero-
sclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed by
aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostic
techniques enable physicians to identify and treat athero-
sclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies and sur-
gical procedures have extended the lives of many patients
who would otherwise have died. Research continues.

Atherosclerosis
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 396  Prevention
A healthy lifestyle—eating right, regular exercise,
maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and control-
ling hypertension—can reduce the risk of developing
atherosclerosis, help keep the disease from progressing,
and sometimes cause it to regress.
• Eat right-A healthy diet reduces excess levels of LDL
cholesterol and triglycerides. It includes a variety of
foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high in
fiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited sodi-
um. Fat should comprise no more than 30%, and saturat-
ed fat no more than 8-10%, of total daily calories
according to the American Heart Association. Choles-
terol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day
and sodium to about 2,400 milligrams. The “Food
Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S. Departments of
Agriculture and Health and Human Services provides
daily guidelines: 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, and
pasta; 3-5 servings of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit;
2-3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 serv-
ings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.
Fats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono-
unsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) are
good alternatives to use for cooking.
• Exercise regularly—Aerobic exercise can lower blood
pressure, help control weight, and increase HDL
(“good”) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vessels
more flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exercise
lasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exercise
periods) four or more times per week is recommended,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and the American College of Sports Medicine.
Aerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, and
cycling, active gardening, climbing stairs, or brisk
housework. A physician should be consulted before
exercise if a person has atherosclerosis or is at
increased risk for it.
• Maintain a desirable body weight—Losing weight can
help reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce triglyc-
erides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It may also reduce
blood pressure. Eating right and exercising are two key
components in maintaining a desirable body weight.
• Do not smoke or use tobacco—Smoking has many
adverse effects on the heart but quitting can repair
damage. Ex-smokers face the same risk of heart dis-
ease as non-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting.
Smoking is the worst thing a person can do to their
heart and lungs.
• Seek treatment for hypertension—High blood pressure
can be controlled through lifestyle changes—reducing
sodium and fat, exercising, managing stress, quitting
KEY TERMS
Arteriosclerosis—Hardening of the arteries. It
includes atherosclerosis, but the two terms are
often used synonymously.
Cholesterol—A fat-like substance that is made by
the human body and eaten in animal products.
Cholesterol is used to form cell membranes and
process hormones and vitamin D. High choles-
terol levels contribute to the development of ath-
erosclerosis.
HDL Cholesterol—About one-third or one-fourth
of all cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol. High levels of HDL, nicknamed “good”
cholesterol, decrease the risk of atherosclerosis.
LDL Cholesterol—Low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol is the primary cholesterol molecule. High
levels of LDL, nicknamed “bad” cholesterol,
increase the risk of atherosclerosis
Plaque—A deposit of fatty and other substances
that accumulates in the lining of the artery wall.
Triglyceride—A fat that comes from food or is
made from other energy sources in the body. Ele-
vated triglyceride levels contribute to the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis.
smoking, and drinking alcohol in moderation—and
medication. Drugs that provide effective treatment are:
diuretics, beta-blockers, sympathetic nerve inhibitors,
vasodilators, angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. Hypertension usu-
ally has no symptoms so it must be checked to be
known. Like cholesterol, hypertension is called a
“silent killer”.

Athlete’s foot
Definition
A common fungus infection between the toes in
which the skin becomes itchy and sore, cracking and
peeling away. Athlete’s foot (also known as tinea pedis or
foot ringworm) can be treated, but it can be tenacious
and difficult to clear up completely.
Description
Athlete’s foot is a very common condition of itchy,
peeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common that most
people will have at least one episode at least once in their
lives. It’s less often found in women and children under
age 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in young
children most probably are caused by some other skin
condition).
Because the fungi grow well in warm, damp areas,
they flourish in and around swimming pools, showers,
and locker rooms. Tinea pedis got its common name
because the infection was common among athletes who	often used these areas.
Causes and symptoms
Athlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that
most often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs. Trichophy-
ton rubrum,T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floc-
cosum, the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual in
that they live exclusively on dead body tissue (hair, the
outer layer of skin, and nails). The fungus grows best in
moist, damp, dark places with poor ventilation. The prob-
lem doesn’t occur among people who usually go barefoot.
Many people carry the fungus on their skin. Howev-
er, it will only flourish to the point of causing athlete’s
foot if conditions are right. Many people believe athlete’s
foot is highly contagious, especially in public swimming
pools and shower rooms. Research has shown, however,
that it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walk-
ing barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactly
why some people develop the condition and others don’t
is not well understood.
Sweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’t
absorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying the
feet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute to the
overgrowth of the fungus.
Symptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skin
on the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, and
blisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of tis-
sue, can cause painand swelling. As the infection
spreads,itchingand burning may get worse.
If it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the
soles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infections
may appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling and
thickened nails, and nail loss. The infection can spread
further if patients scratch and then touch themselves else-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2398
Athlete’s foot
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 398  where (especially in the groin or under the arms). It’s also
possible to spread the infection to other parts of the body
via contaminated bed sheets or clothing.
Diagnosis
Not all foot rashesare athlete’s foot, which is why a
physician should diagnose the condition before any
remedies are used. Using nonprescription products on a
rash that is not athlete’s foot could make the rash worse.
A dermatologist can diagnose the condition by
physical examinationand by examining a preparation
of skin scrapings under a microscope. This test, called a
KOH preparation, treats a sample of tissue scraped from
the infected area with heat and potassium hydroxide
(KOH). This treatment dissolves certain substances in
the tissue sample, making it possible to see the fungi
under the microscope.
Treatment
Athlete’s foot may be resistant to medication and
should not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond well
to antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketocona-
zole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or tolnaf-
tate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, the
doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug.
Untreated athlete’s foot may lead to a secondary
bacterial infection in the skin cracks.
Alternative treatment
A footbath containing cinnamon has been shown to
slow down the growth of certain molds and fungi, and is
said to be very effective in clearing up athlete’s foot. To
make the bath:
• heat four cups of water to a boil
• add eight to 10 broken cinnamon sticks
• reduce heat and simmer five minutes
• remove and let the mixture steep for 45 minutes until
lukewarm
• soak feet
Other herbal remedies used externally to treat ath-
lete’s foot include: a foot soak or powder containing
goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis); tea tree oil (Melaleu-
caspp.); or calendula (Calendula officinalis) cream to
help heal cracked skin.
Prognosis
Athlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment,
but it is important to take all medication as directed by a
dermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of fun-
gus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenail
infections that may accompany athlete’s foot, however,
are typically very hard to treat effectively
Prevention
Good personal hygiene and a few simple precautions
can help prevent athlete’s foot. To prevent spread of ath-
lete’s foot:
• wash feet daily
• dry feet thoroughly (especially between toes)
• avoid tight shoes (especially in summer)
• wear sandals during warm weather
• wear cotton socks and change them often if they get
damp
• don’t wear socks made of synthetic material
• go barefoot outdoors when possible
• wear bathing shoes in public bathing or showering
areas
• use a good quality foot powder
• don’t wear sneakers without socks
• wash towels, contaminated floors, and shower stalls
well with hot soapy water if anyone in the family has
athlete’s foot

Athletic heart syndrome
Definition
Athletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of an ath-
lete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses of strenu-
ous physical training. It can be difficult to distinguish a
significant medical condition from an athletic heart.
Description
The heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging,
especially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases the
cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with each
beat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation depends
on the nature of the physical demand. There are two
types of demand, static and dynamic. Static demand
involves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resis-
tance for brief period. An example is weight lifting.
Dynamic training involves larger groups of muscles at
lower resistance for extended periods of time. Examples
are aerobic training and tennis. Cardiac enlargement is
associated with dynamic training. The heart’s response to
static training is hypertrophy, thickening of the muscle
walls of the heart. As the wall of the heart adapts, there
are changes in the electrical conducting system of the
heart. Because of the larger volume of blood being
pumped with each heart beat, the heart rate when at rest
decreases below the normal level for nonathletes.
Sudden unexpected death(SUD) is the death of an
athlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity.
Often, there is no warning that the person will experience
SUD, although in some cases, warning signs appear
which cause the person to seek medical advice. Impor-
tantly, cases of death occurring during physical activity
are not caused by athletic heart syndrome, but by undiag-
nosed heart disorders.
Causes and symptoms
Athletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a nor-
mal adaptation by the heart to increased physical activity.
The changes in the electrical conduction system of the
heart may be pronounced and diagnostic, but should not	cause problems. In the case of SUD, other heart prob-	lems are involved. In 85-97% of the cases of SUD, an	underlying structural defect of the heart has been noted.
Diagnosis
The changes in the heart beat caused by the electri-
cal conduction system of the heart are detectable on an
electrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in athletic
heart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseases.
Careful examination must be made to distinguish heart
disease from athletic heart syndrome.
Prognosis
The yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people less
than 35 years of age is less than seven incidents per
100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise
related. On a national basis, this means that each year
approximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In persons
over age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55 in
100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring during
exercise.

Atkins diet
Definition
The Atkins diet is a high-protein, high-fat, and very
low-carbohydrate regimen. It emphasizes meat, cheese,
and eggs, while discouraging foods such as bread, pasta,
fruit, and sugar. It is a form of ketogenic diet.
Purpose
The primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substan-
tial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate intake, the
body will burn more fat stored in the body. Since there are
no limits on the amount of calories or quantities of foods
allowed on the diet, there is little hunger between meals.
According to Atkins, the diet can alleviate symptoms of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2400
Athletic heart syndrome
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 400  conditions such as fatigue, irritability, headaches, depres-
sion, and some types of joint and muscle pain.
Description
The regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenic
diet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usually
due to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of car-
bohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen loss,
which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect. Long-
term weight loss occurs because with a low amount of
carbohydrate intake, the body burns stored fat for energy.
The four-step diet starts with a two-week induction
program designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo-
lism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowed
but carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams per
day. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry, fish,
eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of carbohy-
drates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegeta-
bles, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery.
The second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It
allows 15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When the
individual is about 10 pounds from their desired weight,
they begin the pre-maintenance phase. This gradually
adds one to three servings a week of high carbohydrate
foods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheat
bread. When the desired weight is reached, the mainte-
nance stage begins. It allows 40-60 grams of carbohy-
drates per day.
Opinion from the general medical community
remains mixed on the Atkins diet, but is generally unfa-
vorable. There have been no significant long-term scien-
tific studies on the diet. A number of leading medical and
health organizations, including the American Medical
Association, American Dietetic Association (ADA), and
the American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastical-
ly different than the dietary intakes recommended by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Insti-
tutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because the
diet is lacking in some vitaminsand nutrients, and
because it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S. Con-
gress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representative
called the Atkins diet “hazardous” and said it lacked sci-
entific credibility.

DR. ROBERT C. ATKINS (1930– )
Dr. Robert C. Atkins graduated from the University
of Michigan in 1951 and received his medical degree
from Cornell University Medical School in 1955 with a
specialty in cardiology. As an internist and cardiologist
he developed the Atkins Diet in the early 1970s. The diet
is a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and very
low carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha-
sizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods
such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub-
lic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’
Diet Revolution. The book quickly became a bestseller
but unlike most other fad diet books, this one has
remained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28
times and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.
Since then, Atkins has authored a number of other books
on his diet theme, including Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revo-
lution(1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New Diet
Cookbook(1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution:
Nature’s Answer to Drugs(1998).
Atkins has seen about 60,000 patients in his more
than 30 years of practice. He has also appeared on numer-
ous radio and television talk shows, has his own syndicat-
ed radio program, Your Health Choices, and authors the
monthly newsletter Dr. Atkins’ Health Revelations. Atkins
has received the World Organization of Alternative Medi-
cine’s Recognition of Achievement Award and been
named the National Health Federation’s Man of the Year.
He is director of the Atkins Center for Complementary
Medicine which he founded in the early 1980s. The center
is located at 152 E. 55th St., New York, NY 10022.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 401  Preparations
No advance preparation is needed to go on the diet.
However, as with most diets, it is generally considered
appropriate to consult with a physician and to have a
physical evaluation before starting such a nutritional reg-
imen. The evaluation should include blood tests to deter-
mine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin,
and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test is also recom-
mended.
Precautions
Adherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin
and mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-
mends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, includ-
ing a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,
Atkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600
micrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400 mil-
ligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium, and
450-675 mcg of biotin.
The diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari-
ans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro-
tein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannot
follow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy-
drates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends veg-
etarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari-
anism, or at least include fish in their diet.
Side effects
According to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse side
effects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a fact
sheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site
(http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti-
cian and author, said the diet may have serious side
effects for some people. She said complications associat-
ed with the diet include ketosis,dehydration, electrolyte
loss, calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidney
problems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu-
als with medical problems such as heart disease,hyper-
tension, kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over-
weight people with no health problems,” she said.
People with diabetes taking insulin are at risk of
becoming hypoglycemic if they do not eat appropriate
carbohydrates. Also, persons who exerciseregularly may
experience low energy levels and muscle fatigue from
low carbohydrate intake.

Atopic dermatitis
Definition
Eczema is a general term used to describe a variety
of conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin rash.
Atopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, is a non-conta-
gious disorder characterized by chronically inflamed
skin and sometimes intolerable itching.
Description
Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases
that are often associated with stressand allergic disor-
ders that involve the respiratory system, like asthmaand
hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any
age, it is most common in children and young adults.
Symptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do not
affect the patient’s general health.
About one in ten babies develop a form of atopic
dermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin
that oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema most
often occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually
improves before the child’s second birthday, and medical
attention can keep symptoms in check until that time.
When atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,
inflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are less
pronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn from
red to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and become
scaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition can
cause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching asso-
ciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It can
be so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleed,
sometimes causing scarring and infection.
Atopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the population
of the United States, and about 80% of the people who
have the condition have one or more relatives with the
same condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to be
most severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt on
any part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches on
the fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last for
years. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitis
often appears on one or more of the following areas:
• elbow creases
• backs of the knees
• ankles
• wrists
• face
• neck
• upper chest
• palms and between the fingers
Causes and symptoms
While allergic reactions often trigger atopic dermati-
tis, the condition is thought to be the result of an inherit-
ed over-active immune system or a genetic defect that
causes the skin to lose abnormally large amounts of
moisture. The condition can be aggravated by a cycle that
develops in which the skin itches, the patient scratches,
the condition worsens, the itching worsens, the patient
scratches, etc. This cycle must be broken by relieving the
itching to allow the skin time to heal. If the skin becomes

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 403  broken, there is also a risk of developing skin infections
which, if not recognized and treated promptly, can
become more serious.
Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include the following:
• an itchy rash and dry, thickened skin on areas of the
body where moisture can be trapped
• continual scratching
• chronic fatigue, caused when itching disrupts sleep
An individual is more at-risk for developing the con-
dition if there is a personal or family history of atopic
dermatitis, hay fever, asthma, or other allergies. Expo-
sure to any of the following can cause a flare-up:
• hot or cold temperatures
• wool and synthetic fabrics
• detergents, fabric softeners, and chemicals
• use of drugs that suppress immune-system activity
Certain foods, such as peanuts, cow’s milk, eggs,
and fish, can trigger symptoms of atopic dermatitis. A
small percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis find
that their symptoms worsen after having been exposed to
dust, feather pillows, rough-textured fabrics, or other
materials to which dust adheres.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on
the patient’s symptoms and personal and family health
history. Skin tests do not generally provide reliable infor-
mation about this condition.
Treatment
Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured, but the severity
and duration of symptoms can be controlled. A dermatol-
ogist should be consulted when symptoms first appear,
and is likely to recommend warm baths to loosen
encrusted skin, followed by applications of petroleum
jelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skin’s natural
moisture from escaping.
Externally applied (topical) steroids or preparations
containing coal tar can relieve minor itching, but coal tar
has an unpleasant odor, stains clothes, and may increase
skin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid creams in
young children can alter growth. Pregnant women should
not use products that contain coal tar. Topical steroids can
cause itching, burning,acne, permanent stretch marks,
and thinning and spotting of the skin. Applying topical
steroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma.
Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine
(Benadryl), can relieve symptoms of allergy-related atopic
dermatitis. More concentrated topical steroids are recom-
mended for persistent symptoms. A mild tranquilizer may
be prescribed to reduce stress and help the patient sleep,
and antibioticsare used to treat secondary infections.
Cortisone ointments should be used sparingly, and
strong preparations should never be applied to the face,
groin, armpits, or rectal area. Regular medical monitor-
ing is recommended for patients who use cortisone
salves or lotions to control wide-spread symptoms. Oral
cortisone may be prescribed if the patient does not
respond to other treatments, but patients who take the
medication for more than two weeks have a greater-than-
average risk of developing severe symptoms when the
treatment is discontinued.
Allergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis and
sometimes aggravate the symptoms. Since food allergies
may trigger atopic dermatitis, the doctor may suggest

Atopic dermatitis
Infant Adult
Atopic dermatitis can erupt on any part of the skin. In
infants, it often appears on the face, scalp, and knees, while
it develops on the elbows, neck, back of the knees, and
ankles in adults.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 404  eliminating certain foods from the diet if other treatments
prove ineffective.
If symptoms are extremely severe, ultraviolet light
therapy may be prescribed, and a wet body wrap recom-
mended to help the skin retain moisture. This technique,
used most often with children, involves sleeping in a
warm room while wearing wet pajamas under dry cloth-
ing, rain gear, or a nylon sweatsuit. The patient’s face may
be covered with wet gauze covered by elastic bandages,
and his hands encased in wet socks covered by dry ones.
A physician should be notified if the condition is
widespread or resists treatment, or the skin oozes,
becomes encrusted, or smells, as this may indicate an
infection.
Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies can sometimes bring relief or
resolution of atopic dermatitis when conventional thera-
pies are not helping. If the condition becomes increas-
ingly widespread or infected, a physician should be con-
sulted.
Helpful alternative treatments for atopic dermatitis
may include:
• Taking regular brisk walks, followed by bathing in
warm water sprinkled with essential oil of lavender
(Lavandula officinalis); lavender oil acts as a nerve
relaxant for the whole body including the skin
• Supplementing the diet daily with zinc, fish oils, vita-
min A, vitamin E, and evening primrose oil (Oenothera
biennis)—all good sources of nutrients for the skin
• Reducing or eliminating red meat from the diet
• Eliminating or rotating potentially allergic foods such
as cow’s milk, peanuts, wheat, eggs, and soy
• Implementing stress reductiontechniques in daily life.
Herbal therapies also can be helpful in treating
atopic dermatitis. Western herbal remedies used in the
treatment of this condition include burdock (Arctium
lappa) and Ruta(Ruta graveolens). Long-term herbal
therapy requires monitoring and should be guided by an
experienced practitioner.
Other alternative techniques that may be useful in
the treatment of atopic dermatitis include:
• Acupressure (acupuncturewithout needles) to relieve
tension that may trigger a flare
• Aromatherapy, using essential oils like lavender, thyme
(Thymus vulgaris), jasmine (Jasminum officinale) and
chamomile (Matricaria recutita) in hot water, to add a
soothing fragrance to the air
KEY TERMS
Corticosteroid—A steroid hormone produced by
the adrenal gland or as a synthetic compound
that reduces inflammation, redness, rashes, and
irritation.
Dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin.
• Shiatsu massage and reflexology, performed by
licensed practitioners, to alleviate symptoms by restor-
ing the body’s natural balance
• Homeopathy, which may temporarily worsen symp-
toms before relieving them, and should be supervised
by a trained alternative healthcare professional
• Hydrotherapy, which uses water, ice, liquid, and steam,
to stimulate the immune system
• Juice therapy to purify the liver and relieve bowel con-
gestion
• Yoga to induce a sense of serenity.
Prognosis
Atopic dermatitis is unpredictable. Although symp-
toms occur less often with age and sometimes disappear
altogether, they can recur without warning. Atopic der-
matitis lowers resistance to infection and increases the
risk of developing cataracts. Sixty percent of patients
with atopic dermatitis will experience flares and remis-
sions throughout their lives.
Prevention
Research has shown that babies weaned from breast
milk before they are four months old are almost three
times more likely than other babies to develop recurrent
eczema. Feeding eggs or fish to a baby less than one year
old can activate symptoms, and babies should be shielded
from such irritants as mites, molds, pet hair, and smoke.
Possible ways to prevent flare-ups include the fol-
lowing:
• eliminate activities that cause sweating
• lubricate the skin frequently
• avoid wool, perfumes, fabric softeners, soaps that dry
the skin, and other irritants
• avoid sudden temperature changes.
A doctor should be notified whenever any of the fol-
lowing occurs:
• fever or relentless itching develop during a flare

ing coal tar or steroids

Atrial ectopic beats
Definition
Atrial ectopic beats (AEB) refers to a contraction of
the upper heart chamber which occurs before it would be
expected. Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema-
ture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri-
al extrasystole.
Description
An AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the
normal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional-
ly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequence
and then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware of
the event.
Causes and symptoms
As people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre-
quently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB may
be triggered or increased by stress,caffeine,smoking,
and some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrine
or pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci-
dence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the result
of an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reduced
blood supply to that area of the heart.
If a person is aware of the event, the first symptom
of AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped or
missed a beat. This is often accompanied by a feeling
that the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest. The
thumping or pounding is caused by the fact that when
there is an AEB, the pause before the next beat is usually
longer than normal. The next beat must be stronger than
usual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of
the patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocar-
diogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECG
shows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first wave
is called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. An
atrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wave
that occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave.
Treatment
Atrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment.
If treatment is necessary because the beats occur fre-
quently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor may
prescribe medication.
Prognosis
Occasional AEB usually have no significance. If
they increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial tachy-
cardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac output.
Prevention
AEB cannot usually be prevented. Aggravating fac-
tors can be addressed, like excessive stimulants, and
uncontrolled pulmonary disorders.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 406  Atrial fibrillation and flutter
Definition
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are abnormal heart
rhythms in which the atria, or upper chambers of the heart,
are out of sync with the ventricles, or lower chambers of
the heart. In atrial fibrillation, the atria “quiver” chaotical-
ly and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the
atria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles.
Description
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiac
arrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s rhythm. Nearly
2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according to
the American Heart Association. It is the most common
chronic arrhythmia. Atrial flutter is less common, but
both of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to form
in the heart. This can lead to a strokeor a blockage car-
ried by the blood flow (an embolism) anywhere in the
body’s arteries. Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about
15% of strokes.
The atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. In
atrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular.
The atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularly;
the ventricles, the heart’s two large lower chambers, beat
irregularly but not as fast as the atria. When the atria fibril-
late, blood that is not completely pumped out can pool and
form a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is usually very
fast but steady. The atria beat faster than the ventricles.
Atrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various
types of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also result
from an inflammation of the heart’s covering (pericardi-
tis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and cer-
tain medications. Atrial fibrillation is more common in
older people; about 10% of people over the age of 75
have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in peo-
ple with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and other
types of heart disorders.
Causes and symptoms
In most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut-
ter can be found, but often it cannot. Causes of these
heart beat abnormalities include:
• many types of heart disease
•stressand anxiety
•caffeine
• alcohol
• tobacco
• diet pills
• some prescription and over-the-counter medications
• open heart surgery
Symptoms, when present, include:
• a fluttering feeling in the chest
• a pulse that feels like the heart is skipping, racing, jump-
ing, or is irregular
• low energy
• a faint or dizzy feeling
• pressure or discomfort in the chest
• shortness of breath
• anxiety.
Diagnosis
A doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias
using an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to the
sounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are
usually diagnosed through electrocardiography
(EKGs), an exercisestress test, a 24-hour Holter EKG
monitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An EKG shows
the heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen
(ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are
placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. The elec-
trodes send impulses of the heart’s activity through a
monitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that traces
the pattern of the impulses onto paper. The test takes
about 10 minutes and is performed in a doctor’s office.
The exercise stress test measures how the heart and blood
vessels respond to work when the patient is exercising on
a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in
a doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and takes
15-30 minutes.
In 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the patient
wears a small, portable tape recorder connected to disks
on his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm during
normal activities. An EKG called transtelephonic moni-
toring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently.
Like Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoring
continues for days or weeks and enables patients to send
the EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when an
arrhythmia is felt, or to store the information in the
recorder and transmit it later. Doctors can also use high-
frequency sound waves (echocardiography) to deter-
mine the structure and function of the heart. This diag-
nostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlying
heart disease.
Treatment
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated with
medications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion). In
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	407
Atrial fibrillation and flutter
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 407  some cases, removal of a small portion of the heart (abla-
tion), implantation of a pacemaker or a cardioverter
defibrillator, or maze surgery is needed.
If the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled, electri-
cal cardioversion may be used. Cardioversion, the elec-
tric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emer-
gencies. This device briefly suspends the heart’s activity
and allows it to return to a normal rhythm.
Ablation destroys the heart tissue that causes the
arrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheteriza-
tion or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation, per-
formed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory, can
cure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fib-
rillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin tube
called a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threaded
into the heart. At the end of the catheter, a device maps
the electrical pathways of the heart. A cardiologist, a
doctor specializing in the heart, uses this map to identify
the pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia, and then elimi-
nates it (them) with bursts of high-frequency radio
waves. Surgical ablation is performed in an operating
room under general anesthesia. Computerized mapping
techniques are combined with a cold probe to destroy
arrhythmia-causing tissue. Ablation is generally suc-
cessful. When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it is
usually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as well
as drug therapy.
A pacemaker is a battery-powered device about the
size of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near the
collarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires thread-
ed to the right side of the heart supply electrical energy
to pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable car-
dioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhyth-
mias. The battery-powered device senses an abnormal
heart rhythm and automatically provides electrical
shock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and then
allows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire elec-
trodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some of
the electrodes are attached to the outside of the heart
and some are attached to the inside of the heart through
veins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrilla-
tors can be implanted in the chest wall and do not
require open chest surgery. These devices weigh less
than 10 oz and generally last seven or eight years. An
implantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually used
with drug therapy, but the amount medication is
reduced. In maze surgery, often the last resort, surgeons
create a maze of stitches (sutures) that help the heart’s
electrical impulses travel effectively.
Most of the drugs used for treatment have poten-
tial side effects and should be carefully monitored by
a doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rate
and rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation
of blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heart
disease, the heart disease will also be treated. The
American Heart Association recommends aggressive
treatment.
A digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is usually
prescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis drugsslow
the heart’s electrical impulses, helping to restore the nor-
mal rate and rhythm. These drugs also increase the abili-
ty of the heart’s muscular layer to contract and pump
properly. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers
can also be used for this purpose. Beta-blockers slow the
speed of electrical impulses through the heart. Some cal-
cium channel blockers dampen the heart’s response to
erratic electrical impulses.
To prevent blood clots,aspirinor warfarin
(Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, has
potential bleeding side effects, especially in older
patients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter.
This drug is often able to maintain the heart’s proper
rhythm and can also help control the heart rate when the
flutter occurs.
Prognosis
Patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live a
normal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia is
controlled and serious blood clots are prevented.
Prevention
Atrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre-
vented when the cause can be identified and controlled.
Depending on the cause, prevention could include:
• treating the underlying heart disease
• reducing stress and anxiety
• reducing or stopping consumption of caffeine, alcohol,
or tobacco; and/or
• discontinuing diet pills or other medications (over-the-
counter or prescription)

Atrial flutter seeAtrial fibrillation and flutter
KEY TERMS
Arrhythmia—A variation in the normal rhythm of
the heart beat. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two
types of arrhythmia.
Atria—The two small upper chambers of the heart
that receive blood from the lungs and the body.
Stroke—A brain attack caused by a sudden disrup-
tion of blood flow to the brain, in this case
because of a blood clot.
Ventricles—The two large lower chambers of the
heart that pump blood to the lungs and to the rest
of the body.
Atrial septal defect
Definition
An atrial septal defect is an abnormal opening in the
wall separating the left and right upper chambers (atria)
of the heart.
Description
During the normal development of the fetal heart,
there is an opening in the wall (the septum) separating
the left and right upper chambers of the heart. Normally,
this opening closes before birth, but if it does not, the
child is born with a hole between the left and right atria.
This abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defect
and causes blood from the left atrium to flow into the
right atrium.
Different types of atrial septal defects can occur, and
they are classified according to where in the separating
wall they are found. The most commonly found atrial
septal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septum
and accounts for about 70% of all atrial septal defects.
Abnormal openings can form in the upper and lower
parts of the atrial septum as well.
Causes and symptoms
Abnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur-
ing fetal development and are twice as common in
females as in males. These abnormalities can go unno-
ticed if the opening is small, producing no abnormal
symptoms. If the defect is big, large amounts of blood
flowing from the left to the right atrium will cause the
right atrium to swell to hold the extra blood.
People born with an atrial septal defect can have no
symptoms through their twenties, but by age 40, most
people with this condition have symptoms that can
include shortness of breath, rapid abnormal beating of
the atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually heart failure.
Diagnosis
Atrial septal defects can be identified by various
methods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the heart
beats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart with
a stethoscope. In addition, a chest x ray, an electrocar-
diogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heartbeats),
and an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves to
form a detailed image of the heart) can also be used to
identify this condition.
An atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by using
a test called cardiac catheterization. This test involves

bers to measure the amount of oxygen present in the
blood within the heart. If the heart has an opening
between the atria, oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium
enters the right atrium. Through cardiac catheterization,
doctors can detect the higher-than-normal amount of oxy-
gen in the heart’s right atrium, right ventricle, and the
large blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, where
the blood would normally subsequently get its oxygen.
Treatment
Atrial septal defects often correct themselves without
medical treatments by the age of two. If this dose not hap-
pen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed, or by
sewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of the sac that
surrounds the heart (the pericardium), over the opening.
Some patients can have the defect fixed by having an
clam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This plug is a
man-made device that is put in place through a catheter
inserted into the heart.
Prognosis
Individuals with small defects can live a normal life,
but larger defects require surgical correction. Less than
1% of people younger than 45 years of age die from cor-
rective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients can die
from the surgery if they are older than 40 and have other
heart-related problems. When an atrial septal defect is
corrected within the first 20 years of life, there is an
excellent chance for the individual to live normally.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD)
Definition
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
a developmental disorder characterized by distractibility,
hyperactivity, impulsive behaviors, and the inability to
remain focused on tasks or activities.
Description
ADHD, also known as hyperkinetic disorder (HKD)
outside of the United States, is estimated to affect 3-9%
of children, and afflicts boys more often than girls.
Although difficult to assess in infancy and toddlerhood,
signs of ADHD may begin to appear as early as age two
or three, but the symptom picture changes as adolescence
approaches. Many symptoms, particularly hyperactivity,
diminish in early adulthood, but impulsivity and inatten-
tion problems remain with up to 50% of ADHD individu-
als throughout their adult life.
Children with ADHD have short attention spans,
becoming easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks.
Although they may be quite intelligent, their lack of focus
frequently results in poor grades and difficulties in school.
ADHD children act impulsively, taking action first and
thinking later. They are constantly moving, running,
climbing, squirming, and fidgeting, but often have trouble
with gross and fine motor skills and, as a result, may be

extend to the social arena, where they are sometimes
shunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of ADHD are not known. However, it
appears that heredity plays a major role in the develop-
ment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sib-
ling are more likely to develop the disorder themselves.
Before birth, ADHD children may have been exposed to
poor maternal nutrition, viral infections, or maternal
substance abuse. In early childhood, exposure to lead or
other toxins can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic
brain injury or neurological disorders may also trigger
ADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD is
not known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters,
the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages
between nerve cells, is believed to be the mechanism
behind ADHD symptoms.
A widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben
Feingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergiesto
certain foods and food additives caused the characteristic
hyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some chil-
dren may have adverse reactions to certain foods that can
affect their behavior (for example, a rash might tem-
porarily cause a child to be distracted from other tasks),
carefully controlled follow-up studies have uncovered no
link between food allergies and ADHD. Another popular-
ly held misconception about food and ADHD is that the
consumption of sugar causes hyperactive behavior.
Again, studies have shown no link between sugar intake
and ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri-
tionally balanced diet is important for normal develop-
ment in allchildren.
Psychologists and other mental health professionals
typically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV)as a guideline for determining the presence of
ADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD,DSM-IVrequires the
presence of at least six of the following symptoms of
inattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity
and impulsivity combined:
Inattention:
• fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless
mistakes in schoolwork or other activities
• has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities
• does not appear to listen when spoken to
• does not follow through on instructions and does not
finish tasks
• has difficulty organizing tasks and activities
• avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental
effort (e.g., homework)
• is easily distracted
• is forgetful in daily activities
Hyperactivity:
• fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat
• does not remain seated when expected to
• runs or climbs excessively when inappropriate (in ado-
lescence and adults, feelings of restlessness)
• has difficulty playing quietly
• is constantly on the move
• talks excessively
Impulsivity:
• blurts out answers before the question has been com-
pleted
• has difficulty waiting for his or her turn
• interrupts and/or intrudes on others
DSM-IValso requires that some symptoms develop
before age seven, and that they significantly impair func-
tioning in two or more settings (e.g., home and school)
for a period of at least six months. Children who meet the
symptom criteria for inattention, but not for hyperactivi-
ty/impulsivity are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type,
commonly called ADD. (Young girls with ADHD may
not be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtype
of the disorder.)
Diagnosis
The first step in determining if a child has ADHD is
to consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can make
an initial evaluation of the child’s developmental maturi-
ty compared to other children in his or her age group.
The physician should also perform a comprehensive
physical examinationto rule out any organic causes of
ADHD symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid or
vision or hearing problems.
If no organic problem can be found, a psychologist,
psychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learning
specialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehen-
sive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family,
social, psychiatric, and educational history is compiled
from existing medical and school records and from
interviews with parents and teachers. Interviews may
also be conducted with the child, depending on his or
her age. Along with these interviews, several clinical
inventories may also be used, such as the Conners Rat-
ing Scales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Ques-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	411

Achenbach Child Behavior Rating Scales. These inven-
tories provide valuable information on the child’s behav-
ior in different settings and situations. In addition, the
Wender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use in
diagnosing ADHD in adults.
It is important to note that mental disorders such as
depression and anxietydisorder can cause symptoms
similar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psy-
chiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHD
from other possible mood and behavioral disorders.
Bipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed, as
ADHD.
Public schools are required by federal law to offer
free ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can also
provide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialist
for ADHD assessment. Parents should check with their
insurance plans to see if these services are covered.
Treatment
Psychosocial therapy, usually combined with med-
ications, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviate
ADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam-
phetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and methyl-
phenidate (Ritalin) are commonly prescribed to control
hyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase atten-
tion span. They work by stimulating the production of
certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible side
effects of stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heart-
beat, loss of appetite, and insomnia. However, the med-
ications are usually well-tolerated and safe in most cases.
In children who don’t respond well to stimulant ther-
apy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Nor-
pramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are fre-
quently recommended. Reported side effects of these
drugs include persistent dry mouth,sedation, disorien-
tation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly with
desipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHD
therapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres-
sant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; and
carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsant
drug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medica-
tion, has also been used to control aggression and hyper-
activity in some ADHD children, although it should not
be used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medication
will change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp-
toms should be monitored closely and prescriptions
adjusted accordingly.
Behavior modification therapy uses a reward system
to reinforce good behavior and task completion and can
be implemented both in the classroom and at home. A
tangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the child
every time he completes a task or behaves in an accept-
able manner. A chart system may be used to display the
stickers and visually illustrate the child’s progress. When
a certain number of stickers are collected, the child may
trade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zoo
or a day at the beach. The reward system stays in place
until the good behavior becomes ingrained.
A variation of this technique,cognitive-behavioral
therapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by get-
ting the child to recognize the connection between
thoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by chang-
ing negative thinking patterns.
Individual psychotherapy can help an ADHD child
build self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their wor-
ries and anxieties, and help them gain insight into their
behavior and feelings. Family therapymay also be ben-
eficial in helping family members develop coping skills
and in working through feelings of guilt or anger parents
may be experiencing.
ADHD children perform better within a familiar,
consistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce-
ments for good behavior and real consequences for bad.
Family, friends, and caretakers should all be educated on
the special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child.
Communication between parents and teachers is espe-
cially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro-
priate learning environment.
Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD.
Although there is a lack of controlled studies to prove
their efficacy, proponents report that they are successful
in controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients. Some
of the more popular alternative treatments include:

suring brainwave activity and teaching the ADHD
patient which type of brainwave is associated with
attention, EEG biofeedback attempts to train patients to
generate the desired brainwave activity.
• Dietary therapy. Based in part on the Feingold food
allergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritional
plan that is high in protein and complex carbohydrates
and free of white sugar and salicylate-containing foods
such as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.
• Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of natur-
al remedies to address the symptoms of ADHD, such
as ginkgo (Gingko biloba) for memory and mental
sharpness and chamomile (Matricaria recutita) extract
for calming. The safety of herbal remedies has not
been demonstrated in controlled studies. For example,
it is known that gingko may affect blood coagulation,
but controlled studies have not yet evaluated the risk of
the effect.
• Homeopathic medicine. This is probably the most effec-
tive alternative therapy for ADD and ADHD because it
treats the whole person at a core level. Constitutional
homeopathic care is most appropriate and requires con-
sulting with a well-trained homeopath who has experi-
ence working with ADD and ADHD individuals.
Prognosis
Untreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s social
and educational performance and can seriously damage
his or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children have
impaired relationships with their peers, and may be
looked upon as social outcasts. They may be perceived as
slow learners or troublemakers in the classroom. Siblings
and even parents may develop resentful feelings towards
the ADHD child.
KEY TERMS
Conduct disorder—A behavioral and emotional
disorder of childhood and adolescence. Children
with a conduct disorder act inappropriately,
infringe on the rights of others, and violate soci-
etal norms.
Nervous tic—A repetitive, involuntary action, such
as the twitching of a muscle or repeated blinking.
Oppositional defiant disorder—A disorder char-
acterized by hostile, deliberately argumentative,
and defiant behavior towards authority figures.
Some ADHD children also develop a conduct disor-
derproblem. For those adolescents who have both
ADHD and a conduct disorder, up to 25% go on to devel-
op antisocial personality disorder and the criminal behav-
ior, substance abuse, and high rate of suicide attempts that
are symptomatic of it. Children diagnosed with ADHD
are also more likely to have a learning disorder, a mood
disorder such as depression, or an anxiety disorder.
Approximately 70-80% of ADHD patients treated
with stimulant medication experience significant relief
from symptoms, at least in the short-term. Approximate-
ly half of ADHD children seem to “outgrow” the disor-
der in adolescence or early adulthood; the other half will
retain some or all symptoms of ADHD as adults. With
early identification and intervention, careful compliance
with a treatment program, and a supportive and nurturing
home and school environment, ADHD children can
flourish socially and academically.

Audiometry
Definition
Audiometry is the testing of a person’s ability to
hear various sound frequencies. The test is performed
with the use of electronic equipment called an audiome-
ter. This testing is usually administered by a trained tech-
nician called an audiologist.
Purpose
Audiometry testing is used to identify and diagnose
hearing loss. The equipment is used in health screening
programs, for example in grade schools, to detect hearing
problems in children. It is also used in the doctor’s office or
hospital audiology department to diagnose hearing prob-
lems in children, adults, and the elderly. With correct diag-
nosis of a person’s specific pattern of hearing impairment,
the right type of therapy, which might include hearing aids,
corrective surgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.
Precautions
Testing with audiometry equipment is simple and
painless. No special precautions are required.
Description
A trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear-
ing loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry test-
ing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like musical
notes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and at differing
volumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done in
a soundproof testing room.
The person being tested wears a set of headphones
that blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers a
test tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, the
patient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that the
sound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume and
repeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it.
This process is repeated over a wide range of tones or
frequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowest
note played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping-
ing of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is not
unusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ from
one ear to the other.
A second type of audiometry testing uses a headband
rather than headphones. The headband is worn with small
plastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct sound
through the bones of the skull. The patient being tested
senses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations through
the bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, the
tones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes.
The results of the audiometry test may be recorded
on a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph is
generally set up with low frequencies or tones at one end
and high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-
board. Low notes are graphed on the left and high notes
on the right. The graph also charts the volume of the
tones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chart
to loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured in
units called decibels. Most of the sounds associated with
normal speech patterns are generally spoken in the range
of 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing can
detect tones between 0-20 decibels.
Speech audiometry is another type of testing that
uses a series of simple recorded words spoken at various
volumes into headphones worn by the patient being test-
ed. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologist
as it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be able
to recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words.

The ears may be examined with an otoscope prior to
audiometry testing to determine if there are any block-
ages in the ear canal due to ear wax or other material.
Normal results
A person with normal hearing will be able to recog-
nize and respond to all of the tone frequencies adminis-
tered at various volumes in both ears by the audiometry
test. An adult with normal hearing can detect a range of
low and high pitched sounds that are played as softly as
between nearly 0-20 decibels. Normal speech is general-
ly spoken in the range of 20-50 decibels.
Abnormal results
Audiometry test results are considered abnormal if
there is a significant or unexplained difference between
the levels of sound heard between the two ears, or if the
person being tested is unable to hear in the normal range
of frequencies and volume. The pattern of responses dis-
played on the audiogram can be used by the audiologist
to identify if a significant hearing loss is present and if
the patient might benefit from hearing aids or corrective
surgery.

Auditory integration training
Definition
Auditory integration training, or AIT, is one specific
type of music/auditory therapy based upon the work of
French otolaryngologists Dr. Alfred Tomatis and Dr. Guy
Berard.
Origins
The premise upon which most auditory integration
programs are based is that distortion in how things are
heard contributes to commonly seen behavioral or learning
disorders in children. Some of these disorders include
attention deficit/hyperactive disorder(ADHD),autism,
dyslexia, and central auditory processing disorders
(CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate cen-
tral and cortical organization.
Auditory integration is one facet of what audiolo-
gists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin-
ition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi-
ty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, which
is: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditory
integration is actually the perception of sound, including
the ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining it
in both the long- and short-term memory, to be able to
listen to sound selectively, and to localize it.
Guy Berard developed one of the programs com-
monly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con-
sists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi-
cal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran-
dom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listens
through earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer-
cise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done in
sessions twice a day for 10 days.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 415  Alfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the Electronic
Ear. This device operates through a series of filters, and
reestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing. The
basis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow:
• The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt sound
waves into signals that charge the brain.
• Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can be
considered something that nourishes the nervous sys-
tem, either stimulating or destimulating it.
• Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is not
the same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening is
active.
• A person’s ability to listen affects all language develop-
ment for that person. This process influences every
aspect of self-image and social development.
• The capacity to listen can be changed or improved
through auditory stimulation using musical and vocal
sounds at high frequencies.
ALFRED TOMATIS (1920– )
• Communication begins in the womb. As early as the
beginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hear
sounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner-
vous system of the baby to develop.
Description
A quartet of CAP defects have been identified that
can unfavorably alter how each person processes sound.
Among these are:
• Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when the
brain incorrectly decodes what is being heard. Sounds
are unrecognizable, often because the person speaking
talks too fast.
• Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little or
poor tolerance for background sounds.
• Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to put
together things heard with things seen. Characteristical-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2416
Auditory integration training
Internationally renowned French otolaryngologist,
psychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per-
ceived the importance of sound and hearing early in his
career. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine from
the University of Paris and specialized in ear, nose and
throat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatis
early in his career treated some of his parents’ fellow
opera singers. From these experiences with the sound of
music, he developed the principle that has come to be
known as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice can
only sing what it hears.
Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was
his research that made the world aware that the ears of an
infant in utero are already functioning at four and half
months of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour-
ishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated
that the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient
heard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu-
lates the growth of the brain.
Tomatis took this further, into the realm of language.
Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to
be understood are among our most basic needs. He was a
pioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into
social problems for people. “Language is what character-
izes man and makes him different from other creatures,”
Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed
to teach people how to listen effectively are international-
ly respected tools used in the treatment of autism, atten-
tion-deficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.
His listening program, the invention of the Electronic
Ear, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and
music for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably

phonics, or recognizing the symbols for sounds.
• The fourth problem area, often called auditory organi-
zation, overlaps the previous three. It is characterized
by disorganization in handling auditory and other infor-
mation.
Certain audiological tests are carried out to see if the
person has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is.
Other tests give more specific information regarding the
nature of the CAP problem. They include:
• Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea-
sures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, then
bone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibration
of small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.
• Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per-
son’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done by
presenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the per-
son’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scores
equal the percentage of words heard correctly.
• Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessing
the status of, and the protective mechanisms of the mid-
dle ear.
• Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40
compound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibels
above threshold to each ear of the person being tested.
This test provides expanded information that makes it
possible to break down CAP problems into the four
basic types.
• Speech in noise discrimination (SN) testing is similar to
Staggered Sporadic Word testing except that other noise
is also added and the percentage correct in quiet is com-
pared with that correct when there is added noise.
• Phonemic synthesis (PS) determines serious learning
problems. The types of errors made in sounding out
written words or associating written letters with the
sounds they represent help in determining the type and
severity of CAP problems.
Purpose
Upon completion of an auditory integration training
program, the person’s hearing should be capable of per-
ceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same level. Total
improvement from this therapy, in both hearing and
behavior, can take up to one year.
Research and general acceptance
Auditory integration training is based upon newly
learned information about the brain. Though brain struc-
tures and connections are predetermined, probably by
heredity, another factor called plasticityalso comes into
play. Learning, we now know, continues from birth to
death. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actually
change its structuring and connections through the
process of learning.
Problems with auditory processing are now viewed
as having a wide–reaching ripple effect on our society. It
is estimated that 30–40% of children starting school have
language-learning skills that can be described as poor.
CAP difficulties are a factor in several different learning
disabilities. They affect not only academic success, but
also nearly every aspect of societal difficulties. One
example to illustrate this is a 1989 University of Buffalo
study where CAP problems were found to be present in a
surprising 97% of youth inmates in an upstate New York
corrections facility.

and bizarre responses to the environment.
Description
Autism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with the
ability to understand what is seen, heard, and touched.
This can cause profound problems in personal behavior
and in the ability to relate to others. A person with
autism must learn how to communicate normally and
how to relate to people, objects and events. However,
not all patients suffer the same degree of impairment.
There is a full spectrum of symptoms, which can range
from mild to severe.
Autism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000
children. It is found four times more often in boys (usual-
ly the first-born) and occurs around the world in all races
and social backgrounds. Autism usually is evident in the
first three years of life, although in some children it’s
hard to tell when the problem develops. Sometimes the
condition isn’t diagnosed until the child enters school.
While a person with autism can have symptoms
ranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an extraor-
dinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, mem-
ory, music, or art. Such children are known as “autistic
savants” (formerly known as “idiot savants.”).
Causes and symptoms
Autism is a brain disorder that affects the way the
brain uses or transmits information. Studies have found
abnormalities in several parts of the brain that almost
certainly occurred during fetal development. The prob-
lem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsible
for processing language and information from the senses.
There appears to be a strong genetic basis for
autism. Identical twins are more likely to both be
affected than twins who are fraternal (not genetically
identical). In a family with one autistic child, the
chance of having another child with autism is about 1
in 20, much higher than in the normal population.
Sometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mild
behaviors that look very much like autism, such as
repetitive behaviors and social or communication prob-
lems. Research also has found that some emotional dis-
orders (such as manic depression) occur more often in
families of a child with autism.
At least one group of researchers has found a link
between an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may be
just one of at least three to five genes that interact in
some way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect that a
faulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable to
develop autism in the presence of other factors, such as a
chemical imbalance, viruses or chemicals, or a lack of
oxygen at birth.
In a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a dis-
ease such as:
•rubellain the pregnant mother
• tuberous sclerosis
•fragile X syndrome
• encephalitis
• untreated phenylketonuria.
The severity of the condition varies between individ-
uals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual,
repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive behavior) to
very mild, resembling a personality disorder with some
learning disability.
Profound problems with social interaction are the
most common symptoms of autism. Infants with the dis-
order won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and don’t
seem to want or need physical contact or affection. They
may become rigid or flaccid when they are held, cry when
picked up, and show little interest in human contact. Such
a child doesn’t smile or lift his arms in anticipation of
being picked up. He forms no attachment to parents nor
shows any normal anxietytoward strangers. He doesn’t
learn typical games of childhood, such as peek-a-boo.
Language problems
The child with autism may not speak at all; if he
does, it is often in single words. He may endlessly repeat
words or phrases that are addressed to him and may
reverse pronouns (“You go sleep” instead of “I want to
go to sleep”).
Restricted interests and activity
Usually a child with autism has many problems
playing normally. He probably won’t act out adultroles
during play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play, he
may simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someone
else. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common among
autistic children and may include complex rituals,
screaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger
twiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic children
may play with their own saliva, feces or urine.They may
be self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging at
their eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head.
Sensory problems
The sensory world poses a real problem to many
autistic children, who seem overwhelmed by their own
senses. A child with autism may ignore objects or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2418
Autism
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 418  become obsessed with them, continually watching the
object or the movement of his fingers over it. Many of
these children may react to sounds by banging their head
or flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic adults
who have written books about their childhood experi-
ences report that sounds were often excruciatingly
painful to them, forcing them to withdraw from their
environment or try to cope by withdrawing into their own
world of sensation and movement.
Intellectual problems
Most autistic children appear to be moderately mental-
ly retarded. They may giggle or cry for no reason, have no
fear of real danger, but exhibit terror of harmless objects.
Diagnosis
There is no medical test for autism. Because the
symptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may go
undiagnosed for some time (especially in those with mild
cases or if other handicaps are also present). It may be
confused with other diseases, such as fragile X syndrome,
tuberous sclerosis, and untreated phenylketonuria.
Autism is diagnosed by observing the child’s behav-
ior, communication skills, and social interactions. Med-
ical tests should rule out other possible causes of autistic
symptoms. Criteria that mental health experts use to
diagnose autism include:
• problems with developing friendships
• problems with make-believe or social play
• endlessly repeated words or strings of words
• difficulty in carrying on a conversation
• obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns
• preoccupation with parts of objects
Some children have a few of the symptoms of autism,
but not enough to be diagnosed with the “classical” form
of the condition. Children who have autistic behavior but
no problems with language may be diagnosed with
“Asperger syndrome.” Children who seem normal at first
but who begin to show autistic behavior as they get older
might be diagnosed with “childhood disintegrative disor-
der” (CDD). These problems are sometimes called “autis-
tic spectrum disorders.” It is also important to rule out
other problems that seem similar to autism.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 419  Treatment
There is no cure for autism. Treatments are aimed at
reducing specific symptoms. Because the symptoms vary
so widely from one person to the next, there is not a sin-
gle approach that works for every person. A spectrum of
interventions include training in music, listening, vision,
speech and language, and senses. Special dietsand med-
ications may also be prescribed.
Studies show that people with autism can improve
significantly with proper treatment. A child with autism
can learn best with special teachers in a structured pro-
gram that emphasizes individual instruction. The two
most-often studied types of treatment are:
Educational or behavioral treatment
Typically, behavioral techniques are used to help the
child respond and decrease symptoms. This might
include positive reinforcement (food and rewards) to
boost language and social skills. This training includes
structured, skill-oriented instruction designed to boost
social and language abilities. Training needs to begin as
early as possible, since early intervention appears to
influence brain development.
Most experts believe that modern treatment is most
effective when carried out at home, although treatment

Medication
No single medication has yet proved highly effective
for the major features of autism. However, a variety of
drugs can control self-injurious, aggressive, and other of
the more difficult behaviors. Drugs also can control
epilepsy, which afflicts up to 20% of people with autism.
Five types of drugs are sometimes prescribed to help
the behavior problems of people with autism:
• stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin)
• antidepressants, such as fluroxamine (Luvox)
• opiate blockers, such as naltrexone (ReVia)
• antipsychotics
• tranquilizers
Today, most experts recommend a complex treat-
ment regimen that begins early and continues through the
teenage years. Behavioral therapies are used in conjunc-
tion with medications.
Alternative treatment

apy. Some studies have shown that vitamin B

amin B
6causes fewer side effects than other medications
and is considered safe when used in appropriate doses.
However, not many health practitioners advocate its use
in the treatment of autism, citing that the studies showing
its benefit were flawed.
DMG (dimethylglycine)
This compound, available in many health food stores,
is legally classified as a food, not a vitamin or drug. Some
researchers claim that it improves speech in children with
autism. Those who respond to this treatment will usually
do so within a week. Again, many doctors do not feel that
the studies are adequate to promote this treatment.
Exercise
One researcher found that vigorous exercise(20
minutes or longer, three or four days a week) seems to
decrease hyperactivity, aggression, self-injury and other
autistic symptoms.
Prognosis
While there is no cure, with appropriate treatment
the negative behaviors of autism may improve. Earlier
generations placed autistic children in institutions; today,
even severely disabled children can be helped in a less
restrictive environment to develop to their highest poten-
tial. Many can eventually become more responsive to
others as they learn to understand the world around them,
and some can lead nearly normal lives.
People with autism have a normal life expectancy.
Some people with autism can handle a job; they do best
with structured jobs that involve a degree of repetition.
Prevention
Until the cause of autism is discovered, prevention is
not possible.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 421  Autoimmune disorders
Definition
Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which a
person’s immune system attacks the body’s own cells,
causing tissue destruction.
Description
Autoimmunity is accepted as the cause of a wide
range of disorders, and it is suspected to be responsible for
many more. Autoimmune diseases are classified as either
general, in which the autoimmune reaction takes place
simultaneously in a number of tissues, or organ specific, in
which the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ.
Autoimmune disorders include the following:
•Systemic lupus erythematosus. A general autoim-
mune disease in which antibodies attack a number of
different tissues. The disease recurs periodically and is
seen mainly in young and middle-aged women.
•Rheumatoid arthritis. Occurs when the immune sys-
tem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone joints
and cartilage. The disease occurs throughout the body,
although some joints may be more affected than others.
• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies are
deposited in the membranes of both the lung and kid-
neys, causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulus
(glomerulonephritis) and lung bleeding. It is typically
a disease of young males.
• Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds to
specific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them to
make excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Caused by an antibody that
binds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’s
disease, however, this antibody’s action results in less
thyroid hormone being made.
• Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disorders
that affect the skin.
•Myasthenia gravis. A condition in which the immune
system attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cells,
preventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulses
and resulting in severe muscle weakness.
•Scleroderma. Also called CREST syndrome or pro-
gressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma affects the
connective tissue.
• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Occurs when the
body produces antibodies that coat red blood cells.
• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Disorder in
which the immune system targets and destroys blood
platelets.
•Polymyositisand Dermatomyositis. Immune disorders
that affect the neuromuscular system.
•Pernicious anemia. Disorder in which the immune
system attacks the lining of the stomach in such a way
that the body cannot metabolize vitamin B
12.
• Sjögren’s syndrome. Occurs when the exocrine glands
are attacked by the immune system, resulting in exces-
sive dryness.
•Ankylosing spondylitis. Immune system induced
degeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine.
•Vasculitis. A group of autoimmune disorders in which
the immune system attacks and destroys blood vessels.
• Type I diabetes mellitus. May be caused by an anti-
body that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the pan-
creas, which produce insulin.
• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. Also called Lou
Gehrig’s disease. An immune disorder that causes the
deathof neurons which leads to progressive loss of
muscular control.
• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also called infectious
polyneuritis. Often occurring after an infection or an
immunization (specifically Swine flu), the disease
affects the myelin sheath, which coats nerve cells. It
causes progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.
•Multiple sclerosis. An autoimmune disorder that may
involve a virus affects the central nervous system, caus-
ing loss of coordination and muscle control.
Causes and symptoms
To further understand autoimmune disorders, it is
helpful to understand the workings of the immune sys-
tem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend the
body against attack by infectious microbes (germs) and
foreign objects. When the immune system attacks an
invader, it is very specific—a particular immune system
cell will only recognize and target one type of invader.
To function properly, the immune system must not only
develop this specialized knowledge of individual
invaders, but it must also learn how to recognize and
not destroy cells that belong to the body itself. Every
cell carries protein markers on its surface that identifies
it in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is (e.g. nerve
cell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to whom that cell
belongs. These markers are called major histocompata-
bility complexes (MHCs). When functioning properly,
cells of the immune system will not attack any other
cell with markers identifying it as belonging to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2422
Autoimmune disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 422  body. Conversely, if the immune system cells do not
recognize the cell as “self,” they attach themselves to it
and put out a signal that the body has been invaded,
which in turn stimulates the production of substances
such as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreign
particles. In case of autoimmune disorders, the immune
system cannot distinguish between “self” cells and
invader cells. As a result, the same destructive operation
is carried out on the body’s own cells that would nor-
mally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and other such
harmful entities.
The reasons why immune systems become dys-
functional in this way is not well understood. However,
most researchers agree that a combination of genetic,
environmental, and hormonal factors play into autoim-
munity. Researchers also speculate that certain mecha-
nisms may trigger autoimmunity. First, a substance that
is normally restricted to one part of the body, and there-
fore not usually exposed to the immune system, is
released into other areas where it is attacked. Second,
the immune system may mistake a component of the
body for a similar foreign component. Third, cells of
the body may be altered in some way, either by drugs,
infection, or some other environmental factor, so that
they are no longer recognizable as “self” to the immune
system. Fourth, the immune system itself may be dam-
aged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore can-
not function properly.
Symptoms
The symptoms of the above disorders include:
• Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include
fever, chills,fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes(particu-
larly the classic “butterfly” rash on the face), vasculitis,
polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth or
nose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems, and,
in women, irregular periods. About half of those who
suffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems,
and some may also develop urinary problems. Lupus
can also effect the central nervous system, causing
seizures, depression, and psychosis.
• Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized by a
low-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and a gener-
alized painin the joints. The joint pain then becomes
more specific, usually beginning in the fingers, then
spreading to other areas, such as the wrists, elbows,
knees, and ankles. As the disease progresses, joint func-
tion diminishes sharply and deformities occur, particular-
ly the characteristic “swan’s neck” curling of the fingers.
• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to that
of iron deficiency anemia, including fatigue and pal-
lor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range from a
coughthat produces bloody sputum to outright hemor-
rhaging. Symptoms involving the urinary system
include blood in the urine and/or swelling.
• Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an
enlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss of
appetite, sweating, heart palpitations, nervousness,
and an inability to tolerate heat.
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis-
plays no symptoms.
• Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by
blisters and deep lesions on the skin.
• Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus-
cle weakness that at first may be confined to certain
muscle groups, but then may progress to the point of
paralysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have expres-
sionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swal-
lowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory sys-
tem, artificial respiration may be required.
• Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by Ray-
naud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow include
pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and the skin
takes on a tight, shiny appearance. The digestive system
also becomes involved, resulting in weight loss, appetite
loss,diarrhea,constipation, and distention of the
abdomen. As the disease progresses, the heart, lungs,
and kidneys become involved, and malignant hyperten-
sioncauses death in approximately 30% of cases.
• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or
chronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal ten-
derness due to an enlarged spleen.
• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized
by pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplained
bruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in
the stool.
• Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,
symptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in the
shoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from per-
forming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis, the
same muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash that
appears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips. A rash
may also appear on the eyelids, and the area around the
eyes may become swollen.
• Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia
include weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, and
tingling in the extremities. Because the disease caus-
es a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, loss
of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipation
are possible. Also, because Vitamin B
12is essential
for the nervous system function, the deficiency of it
brought on by the disease can result in a host of neu-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	423
Autoimmune disorders
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 423  rological problems, including weakness, lack of coor-
dination, blurred vision, loss of fine motor skills, loss
of the sense of taste, ringing in the ears, and loss of
bladder control.
• Sjögren’s syndrome. Characterized by excessive dry-
ness of the mouth and eyes.
• Ankylosing spondylitis. Generally begins with lower
back pain that progresses up the spine. The pain may
eventually become crippling.
• Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of veins
affected and can range greatly.
• Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue and
an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood
(hyperglycemia).
• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum-
bling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, muscle
cramps and twitching may be observed as well as
weakness in the hands making fastening buttons or
turning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed or
slurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. As
respiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased danger
of aspiration or lung infection.
• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legs
occurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (a
prickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorder
affects both sides of the body and may involve paralysis
and the muscles that control breathing.
• Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the first
symptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or exhaustion
is often reported, as well as blurry or double vision.
There may be dizziness, depression, loss of bladder
control, and muscle weakness so severe that the patient
is confined to a wheelchair.
Diagnosis
A number of tests are involved in the diagnosis of
autoimmune diseases, depending on the particular dis-
ease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, elec-
tromylogram (measures muscle function), and magnetic
resonance imagingof the brain. Usually, these tests
determine the location and extent of damage or involve-
ment. They are useful in charting progress of the disease
and as baselines for treatment.
The principle tool, however, for authenticating
autoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such tests
involve measuring the level of antibodies found in the
blood and determining if they react with specific anti-
gens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. An
elevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoral
immune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibody
levels are also seen in common infections, they must be
ruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels.
Antibodies can also be typed by class. There are five
classes of antibodies, and they can be separated in the
laboratory. The class IgG is usually associated with
autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class antibod-
ies are also the main class of antibody seen in normal
immune responses.
The most useful antibody tests involve introducing
the patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her own tis-
sue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney tissue. If
antibodies bind to the “self” tissue, it is diagnostic for an
autoimmune disorder. Antibodies from a person without
an autoimmune disorder would not react to “self” tissue.
Treatment
Treatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to
the disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating or
preventing symptoms rather than correcting the under-
lying cause. For example, if a gland involved in an
autoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone such
as insulin, administration of that hormone is required.
Administration of a hormone, however, will restore
the function of the gland damaged by the autoimmune
disease.
The other aspect of treatment is controlling the
inflammatory and proliferative nature of the immune
response. This is generally accomplished with two types
of drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control inflam-
mation. There are many different steroids, each having
side effects. The proliferative nature of the immune
response is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs.
These drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cells
and, therefore, also suppress non-immune cells leading
to side effects such as anemia.
Systemic enzyme therapyis a new treatment that is
showing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero-
sis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory dis-
eases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin, trypsin,
chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help stimulate the
body’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order to
reduce swelling and improve circulation, and break up
the immune complexes within the bloodstream. Symp-
toms have been reduced using this treatment.
Other treatments that hold some promise are irradia-
tion of the spleen and gene therapy. Splenic irradiation
is touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with autoim-
mune blood diseases, especially autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, or others with compromised immune systems,
such as HIV patients and the elderly. It is reported to
have few side effects and seems to be working. Cytokine

tissue also appear to be effective in treating Type I dia-
betes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroditis,
and arthritis.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends upon the pathology of each
autoimmune disease.
Prevention
Most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented.
Though the mechanisms involved in how these diseases
affect the body are known, it is still unclear why the body
turns on itself. Since more women than men seem to be
affected by some of these disorders (e.g. lupus), some
researchers are looking into hormones as a factor. This,
and gene therapy, may be the preventatives of the future.

Autopsy
Definition
An autopsy is a postmortem assessment or examina-
tion of a body to determine the cause of death. An autop-
sy is performed by a physician trained in pathology.
Purpose
Most autopsies advance medical knowledge and
provide evidence for legal action. Medically, autopsies
determine the exact cause and circumstances of death,
discover the pathway of a disease, and provide valuable
information to be used in the care of the living. When
foul play is suspected, a government coroner or medical
examiner performs autopsies for legal use. This branch
of medical study is called forensic medicine. Forensic
specialists investigate deaths resulting from violence or
occurring under suspicious circumstances.
Benefits of research from autopsies include the pro-
duction of new medical information on diseases such as
toxic shock syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). Organ donation, which can potential-
ly save the lives of other patients, is also another benefit
of autopsies.
Precautions
When performed for medical reasons, autopsies
require formal permission from family members or the
legal guardian. (Autopsies required for legal reasons
when foul play is suspected do not need the consent of
next of kin.) During the autopsy, very concise notes and
documentation must be made for both medical and legal
reasons. Some religious groups prohibit autopsies.

Autopsy
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 425  Description
An autopsy can be described as the examination of a
deceased human body with a detailed exam of the per-
son’s remains. This procedure dates back to the Roman
era when few human dissections were performed; autop-
sies were utilized, however, to determine the cause of
death in criminal cases. At the beginning of the proce-
dure the exterior body is examined and then the internal
organs are removed and studied. Some pathologists
argue that more autopsies are performed than necessary.
However, recent studies show that autopsies can detect
major findings about a person’s condition that were not
suspected when the person was alive. And the growing
awareness of the influence of genetic factors in disease
has also emphasized the importance of autopsies.
Despite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autopsies
have been performed in the United States during the past
KEY TERMS
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)—	A group of diseases resulting from infection with	the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A per-	son infected with HIV gradually loses immune	function, becoming less able to resist aliments and	cancers, resulting in eventual death.
Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—The tech-
nique used in diagnostic studies of internal bodily
structures in the detection of tumors or brain
aneurysms. This diagnostic test consists of a com-
puter analysis of a series of cross-sectional scans
made along a single axis of a bodily structure or
tissue that is used to construct a three-dimensional
image of that structure
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease—A rare, often fatal dis-
ease of the brain, characterized by gradual demen-
tia and loss of muscle control that occurs most
often in middle age and is caused by a slow virus.
Hepatitis—Inflammation of the liver, caused by
infectious or toxic agents and characterized by
jaundice, fever, liver enlargement, and abdominal
pain.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—A diagnostic
tool that utilizes nuclear magnetic energy in the
production of images of specific atoms and molec-
ular structures in solids, especially human cells,
tissues, and organs.
Postmortem—After death.
10-20 years. A possible reason for this decline is concern
about malpractice suits on the part of the treating physi-
cian. Other possible reasons are that hospitals are per-
forming fewer autopsies because of the expense or
because modern technology, such as CT scans and mag-
netic resonance imaging, can often provide sufficient
diagnostic information. Nonetheless, federal regulators
and pathology groups have begun to establish new guide-
lines designed to increase the number and quality of
autopsies being performed.
Many experts are concerned that if the number of
autopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to charge
families a fee for the procedure as autopies are not nor-
mally covered by insurance companies or Medicare. Yet,
according to several pathologists, the benefit of the pro-
cedure for families and doctors does justify the cost. In
medical autopsies, physicians remain cautious to exam-
ine only as much of the body as permitted according to
the wishes of the family. It is important to note that
autopsies can also provide peace of mind for the
bereaved family in certain situations.
Preparation
If a medical autopsy is being performed, written per-
mission is secured from the family of the deceased
Aftercare
Once the autopsy has been completed, the body is
prepared for final arrangements according to the family’s
wishes
Risks
There are some risks of disease transmission from
the deceased. In fact, some physicans may refuse to do
autopsies on specific patients because of a fear of con-
tracting diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, or Creutzfeld-
Jakob disease.
Normal results
In most situations the cause of death is determined
from the procedure of an autopsy without any transmis-
sion of disease.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results would include inconclusive results
from the autopsy and transmission of infectious disease
during the autopsy.

Aviation medicine
Definition
Also known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine,
or space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical spe-
cialty that focuses on the physical and psychological
conditions associated with flying and space travel.
Purpose
Since flying airplanes and spacecraft involves great
risk and physical demands, such as changes in gravity
and oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical experts
to protect their safety and the public’s safety.
Description
Pressure changes
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly above 14,500 ft
(4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure changes caused by
lower oxygen levels at high altitude. Pilots must either
have a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen mask.
Without these protections, they could experience hypox-
ia, or altitude sickness. Hypoxia reduces the amount of
oxygen in the brain, causing such symptoms as
dizziness,shortness of breath, and mental confusion.
These symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control of
the plane. Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy.
Rapid altitude increases and decreases can cause
painbecause there is an air pocket in the middle portion
of the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typ-
ically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinuses
by plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrums
“pop.” Other options include yawning, swallowing or
chewing gum. For people with a cold or a severely	blocked middle ear, the use of decongestants,antihista-
mines, or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps to
equalize pressure, the tympanic membrane could rupture,
causing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness, and nausea.
Gravity’s impact
Fighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can
experience health problems during rapid acceleration and
when executing tight turns at high speed. During these
moves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditions
that can pull blood away from the brain and heart and
into the lower body. This can cause the pilot to have tun-
nel vision or pass out. To prevent these potentially deadly
situations, the military requires fighter pilots to wear spe-
cial flight suits, or G suits, which have compartments
that fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling in
the lower body.
Some pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique
called the Valsalva Maneuverinstead of G suits to pre-
vent black outs during high-performance flying. The Val-
salva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening the
abdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in the
wrong parts of the body.
PREVENTIVE CARE.Since any routine health problem
that affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds of
lives, aviation medicine specialists who work for com-
mercial airlines and the military take special care to edu-
cate pilots about proper diet,exerciseand preventive
health tools. For example, physicians may frequently
screen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucomaor
cataracts. They also will check for hearing loss and
encourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones to
buffer engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi-
cians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostic
tests such as an ECG or stress test.
Motion sickness
Many people experience nausea, vertigo, and disori-
entation when they first arrive in space. This is caused by
changes in the fluid in the inner ear, which is sensitive to
gravity and affects our sense of spatial orientation. The
symptoms typically ease after several days, but often
recur when the astronaut returns to Earth. To treat this
condition, physicians give astronauts motion sickness
medication, such as lorazepam.
Bone and muscle loss
In zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone and
muscle mass. On earth, the natural resistance of gravity
helps build stronger muscles and bones during normal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	427
Aviation medicine
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 427  weight-bearing activities like walking or even sitting at a
desk. In space, however, astronauts must work harder to
prevent bone and muscle loss. Exercise is an important
treatment. Crew members may use an exercise cycle or
resistive rubber bands to stay in shape. Physicians also may
give them medication to prevent bone loss and prescribe
nutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essential
amino acids and carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy.
Radiation
Another health threat to space travelers is radiation.
Harmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells and
cause cancer. Excess radiation also can weaken the
immune system. To prevent these problems, physicians
may give astronauts nutritional supplements. For exam-
ple, research has show that n-3 fatty acids found in fish
oil reduce DNA damage.
Cardiovascular issues
When astronauts return to earth after a long mission,
they tend to feel dizzy and black out. Scientists are con-
cerned about this dilemma because it could be dangerous
if the crew members need to make an emergency exit.
One way to prevent this problem, which is caused by a
drop in blood pressure, is to have the astronauts drink
extra fluids and increase salt intake to increase blood vol-
ume. Physicians also may prescribe medication that
causes blood vessels to contract. As another precaution,
astronauts also put on protective flight suits, or G suits,
before they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere.
KEY TERMS
G suits—Special flight suits, worn by fighter pilots,
which have compartments that fill with air or fluid
to keep blood from pooling in the lower body dur-
ing rapid acceleration and tight turns.
Hypoxia—Hypoxia, or altitude sickness, reduces
the amount of oxygen in the brain causing such
symptoms as dizziness, shortness of breath, and
mental confusion.
Tympanic membrane—A structure in the middle
ear that can rupture if pressure in the ear is not
equalized during airplane ascents and descents.
Valsalva Maneuver—Pilots grunt and tighten their
abdominal muscles to prevent black outs during
high-performance flying.

Ayurvedic medicine
Definition
Ayurvedic medicine is a system of healing that
originated in ancient India. In Sanskrit,ayurmeans
life or living, and vedameans knowledge, so Ayurveda
has been defined as the “knowledge of living” or the
“science of longevity.” Ayurvedic medicine utilizes
diet,detoxificationand purification techniques,
herbal and mineral remedies,yoga, breathing exercis-
es,meditation, and massage therapyas holistic heal-
ing methods. Ayurvedic medicine is widely practiced
in modern India and has been steadily gaining follow-
ers in the West.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2428
Aviation medicine
GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 428  Purpose
According to the original texts, the goal of Ayurveda
is prevention as well as promotion of the body’s own
capacity for maintenance and balance. Ayurvedic treat-
ment is non-invasive and non-toxic, so it can be used
safely as an alternative therapy or alongside conventional
therapies. Ayurvedic physicians claim that their methods
can also help stress-related, metabolic, and chronic con-
ditions. Ayurveda has been used to treat acne,allergies,
asthma,anxiety, arthritis,chronic fatigue syndrome,
colds, colitis,constipation, depression, diabetes, flu,
heart disease,hypertension, immune problems, inflam-
mation,insomnia, nervous disorders,obesity, skin prob-
lems, and ulcers.
Ayurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots of a
disease before it gets so advanced that more radical treat-
ments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda seems to be limited
in treating severely advanced conditions, traumatic
injuries, acute pain, and conditions and injuries requiring
invasive surgery. Ayurvedic techniques have also been
used alongside chemotherapyand surgery to assist
patients in recovery and healing.
Description
Origins
Ayurvedic medicine originated in the early civiliza-
tions of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is men-
tioned in the Vedas, the ancient religious and philosophi-
cal texts that are the oldest surviving literature in the
world, which makes Ayurvedic medicine the oldest sur-
viving healing system. According to the texts, Ayurveda
was conceived by enlightened wise men as a system of
living harmoniously and maintaining the body so that
mental and spiritual awareness could be possible. Med-
ical historians believe that Ayurvedic ideas were trans-
ported from ancient India to China and were instrumental
in the development of Chinese medicine.

DEEPAK CHOPRA (1946– )
Deepak Chopra was born in India and studied medi-
cine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. He left
his home for the United States in 1970 and completed
residencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. He
went on to teaching posts at major medical institutions—
Tufts University and Boston University schools of medi-
cine—while establishing a very successful private prac-
tice. By the time he was thirty-five, Chopra had become
chief of staff at New England Memorial Hospital.
Disturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on med-
ication, he began a search for alternatives and discovered
one in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an
Indian spiritualist who had gained a cult following in the
late sixties teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM).
Chopra began practicing TM fervently and eventually met
the Maharishi. In 1985 Chopra established the Ayurvedic
Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral
Medicine in Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he began
his practice of integrating the best aspects of Eastern and
Western medicine.
In 1993, he published Creating Affluence: Wealth
Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, and the
enormously successful best seller, Ageless Body, Timeless
Mind. In the latter he presents his most radical thesis: that
aging is not the inevitable deterioration of organs and
mind that we have been traditionally taught to think of it
as. It is a process that can be influenced, slowed down,
and even reversed with the correct kinds of therapies,
almost all of which are self-administered or self-taught.
He teaches that applying a regimen of nutritional bal-
ance, meditation, and emotional clarity characterized by
such factors as learning to easily and quickly express
anger, for instance, can lead to increased lifespans of up
to 120 years.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 429  Today, Ayurvedic medicine is used by 80% of the
population in India. Aided by the efforts of Deepak
Chopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasingly
accepted alternative medical treatment in America during
the last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has written
several bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He also
helped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine in
La Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that trains
physicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces herbal
remedies, and conducts research and documentation of
its healing techniques.
Key ideas
To understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary to
have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body.
The basic life force in the body is prana, which is also
found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese
notion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and
expert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,
nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,
and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light-
rays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through
which the prana is carried.”
In Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that con-
tain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These ele-
ments interact and are further organized in the human
body as three main categories or basic physiological
principles in the body that govern all bodily functions
known as the doshas. The three doshas are vata, pitta,
and kapha. Each person has a unique blend of the three
doshas, known as the person’s prakriti, which is why
Ayurvedic treatment is always individualized. In
Ayurveda, disease is viewed as a state of imbalance in
one or more of a person’s doshas, and an Ayurvedic
physician strives to adjust and balance them, using a
variety of techniques.
The vata dosha is associated with air and ether, and
in the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo-
ple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned,
and very energetic and mentally restless. When vata is
out of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper-
activity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches.
Pitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, it
is responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta char-
acteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strong
digestion, and good mental concentration. Pitta imbal-
ances show up as anger and aggression and stress-relat-
ed conditions like gastritis, ulcers, liver problems, and
hypertension.
The kapha dosha is associated with water and earth.
People characterized as kapha are generally large or
heavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow,
calm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional-
ly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity,
fatigue,bronchitis, and sinus problems.
Diagnosis
In Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as an
imbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic process
strives to determine which doshas are underactive or
overactive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over a
course of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician to
most accurately determine what parts of the body are
being affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physi-
cians often use long questionnaires and interviews to
determine a person’s dosha patterns and physical and
psychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intri-
cately observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fin-
gernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believe
can indicate deeper problems in the internal systems.
Some Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests to
assist in diagnosis.

Ayurvedic treatment seeks to re-establish balance
and harmony in the body’s systems. Usually the first
method of treatment involves some sort of detoxification
and cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulated
toxins must be removed before any other methods of
treatment will be effective. Methods of detoxification
include therapeutic vomiting,laxatives, medicated ene-
mas,fasting, and cleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayur-
vedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods into
intensive sessions known as panchakarma. Panchakarma
can take several days or even weeks and they are more
than elimination therapies. They also include herbalized
oil massage and herbalized heat treatments. After purifi-
cation, Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineral
remedies to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicine
contains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specific
health problems.
Ayurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people live
their lives from day to day, believing that proper lifestyles
and routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and preven-
tion. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exerciseto
build strength and health, and also advises massage thera-
py and self-massage as ways of increasing circulation and
reducing stress. Yogic breathing techniques and medita-
tion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, to
reduce stress and improve mental energy.
Of all treatments, though, diet is one of the most
basic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system.
An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and indi-
vidualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are six
basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astrin-
gent. Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggra-
vate a particular dosha. For instance, sweet, sour, and
salty decrease vata problems and increase kapha. Sour,
salty, and pungent can increase pitta. After an Ayurvedic
physician determines a person’s dosha profile, they will
recommend a specific diet to correct imbalances and
increase health. The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarily
vegetarian foods of high quality and freshness, tailored to
the season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten in
the summer and heating ones in the winter, always within
a person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine, the heav-
iest meal of the day should be lunch, and dinner should
eaten well before bedtime, to allow for complete diges-
tion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with proper
chewing and state of mind is important, as is combining
foods properly and avoiding overeating.
Cost
Costs of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with initial
consultations running anywhere from $40 to over $100,

with follow-up visits costing less. Herbal treatments may
cost from $10 to $50 per month, and are often available
from health food or bulk herb stores. Some clinics offer
panchakarma, the intensive Ayurvedic detoxification
treatment, which can include overnight stays for up to
several weeks. The prices for these programs can vary
significantly, depending on the services and length of
stay. Insurance reimbursement may depend on whether
the primary physician is a licensed M.D.
Preparations
Ayurveda is a mind/body system of health that con-
tains some ideas foreign to the Western scientific
model. Those people considering Ayurveda should
approach it with an open mind and willingness to
experiment. Also, because Ayurveda is a whole-body
system of healing and health, patience and discipline
are helpful, as some conditions and diseases are
believed to be brought on by years of bad health habits
and require time and effort to correct. Finally, the
Ayurvedic philosophy believes that each person has the
ability to heal themselves, so those considering Ayurve-
da should be prepared to bring responsibility and partic-
ipation into the treatment.
Precautions
An Ayurvedic practitioner should always be consulted.
Side effects
During Ayurvedic detoxification programs, some
people report fatigue, muscle soreness, and general sick-
ness. Also, as Ayurveda seeks to release mental stresses
and psychological problems from the patient, some peo-
ple can experience mental disturbances and depression
during treatment, and psychological counseling may be
part of a sound program.

GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 431  Research and general acceptance
Because Ayurveda had been outside the Western sci-
entific system for years, research in the United States is
new. Another difficulty in documentation arises because
Ayurvedic treatment is very individualized; two people
with the same disease but different dosha patterns might
be treated differently. Much more scientific research has
been conducted over the past several decades in India.
Much research in the United States is being supported by
the Maharishi Ayur-Ved organization, which studies the
Ayurvedic products it sells and its clinical practices.
Some Ayurvedic herbal mixtures have been proven to
have high antioxidant properties, much stronger than vita-
minsA, C, and E, and some have also been shown in labo-
ratory tests to reduce or eliminate tumors in mice and to
inhibit cancergrowth in human lung tumor cells. In a
1987 study at MIT, an Ayurvedic herbal remedy was
shown to significantly reduce colon cancerin rats. Anoth-
er study was performed in the Netherlands with Maharishi
Ayur-Ved products. A group of patients with chronic ill-
nesses, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, hyperten-
sion, eczema,psoriasis, constipation,rheumatoid arthri-
tis, headaches, and non-insulin dependent diabetes melli-
tus, were given Ayurvedic treatment. Strong results were
observed, with nearly 80% of the patients improving and
some chronic conditions being completely cured.
Other studies have shown that Ayurvedic therapies
can significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure in
stress-related problems. Diabetes, acne, and allergies
have also been successfully treated with Ayurvedic reme-
dies. Ayurvedic products have been shown to increase
short-term memory and reduce headaches. Also,
Ayurvedic remedies have been used successfully to sup-
port the healing process of patients undergoing
chemotherapy, as these remedies have been demonstrated
to increase immune system activity.

Babesiosis
Definition
Babesiosis is an infection of red blood cells caused
by the single-celled parasite,Babesia microti, which is
spread to humans by a tick bite.
Description
Babesiosis is a rare, tick-transmitted disease that is
caused most often by the single-celled parasite Babesia
microti. By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of babesiosis had
been reported in the United States. The disease occurs
primarily in New England and New York, especially on
the coastal islands. However, cases have occurred in
other parts of the United States. Because of tick activity,
the risk for babesiosis is highest during June and July.
Ticks are small, blood-sucking arachnids. Although
some ticks carry disease-causing organisms, most do not.
Babesia microtiis spread to humans through the bite of
the tick Ixodes scapularis(also called Ixodes dammini).
Ixodes scapularis, called the “blacklegged deer tick,” usu-
ally feeds on deer and mice. A tick picks up the parasites
by feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them on
by biting a new host, possibly a human. To pass on the
parasites, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48
hours. Once in the bloodstream,Babesia microtienters a
red blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroys
the cell. Humans infected with Babesia microtiproduce
antibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the infection.
Causes and symptoms
Babesia microtilive and divide within red blood
cells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. The
majority of people who are infected have no visible	symptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appear	one to six weeks following the tick bite. Because the	ticks are small, many patients have no recollection of a	tick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired-	ness, loss of appetite,fever, drenching sweats, and mus-
cle pain. Nausea, vomiting,headache, shaking chills,
blood in the urine, and depression can occur.
Persons who are over 40 years old, have had their
spleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a serious
disease (cancer,AIDS, etc.) are at a greater risk for
severe babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up to
85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes a
serious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency.
Diagnosis
Babesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a blood
sample microscopically and detecting the presence of
Babesia microtiwithin the blood cells. The blood can also
be checked for the presence of antibodies to the parasite.
Treatment
In serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a combi-
nation of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine. Clin-
damycin is given by injection and quinine is given orally
three to four times a day for four to seven days. To
reduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely ill
patients have been treated with blood transfusions.
Prognosis
Otherwise healthy patients will recover completely.
Babesiosis may last several months without treatment
and is a severe, potentially fatal disease in splenec-
tomized patients.
Prevention
The only prevention for babesiosis is to minimize
exposure to ticks by staying on trails when walking

sleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, wearing insect
repellent, and checking for ticks after an outing. Remove
a tick as soon as possible by grasping the tick with tweez-
ers and gently pulling. Splenectomized people should
avoid northeastern coastal regions during the tick season.

Bacillary angiomatosis
Definition
A life-threatening but curable infection that causes
an eruption of purple lesions on or under the skin that
resemble Kaposi’s sarcoma. The infection, which
occurs almost exclusively in patients with AIDS, can be
a complication of cat-scratch disease.
Description
Bacillary angiomatosis is a re-emerging bacterial
infection that is identical or closely related to one which
commonly afflicted thousands of soldiers during World
War I. Today, the disease, caused by two versions of the
KEY TERMS

same bacteria, is linked to homeless AIDS patients and to
those afflicted with cat-scratch disease.
The infection is rarely seen today in patients who
don’t have HIV. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV patient diag-
nosed with bacillary angiomatosis is considered to have
progressed to full-blown AIDS.
Causes and symptoms
Scientists have recently isolated two varieties of the
Bartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomato-
sis:Bartonella(formerly Rochalimaeaquintana) and B.
henselae(cause of cat-scratch disease).
B. quintanainfection is known popularly as trench
fever, and is the infection associated with body lice that
sickened European troops during World War I. Lice carry
the bacteria, and can transmit the infection to humans.
The incidence of trench feverwas believed to have faded
away with the end of World War I. It was not diagnosed
in the United States until 1992, when 10 cases were
reported among homeless Seattle men.
The related bacteria B. henselaewas first identified
several years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever. It also
can lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS patients.
Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is trans-
mitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.
These two different types of bacteria both cause
bacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterized
by wildly proliferating blood vessels that form tumor-like
masses in the skin and organs. The nodules that appear in
bacillary angiomatosis are firm and don’t turn white when
pressed. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, in
numbers ranging from one to 100. They are rarely found
on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or in the mouth.
As the number of lesions increase, the patient may devel-
op a high fever, sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting,
and weight loss. If untreated, infection may be fatal.
In addition to the basic disease process, the two dif-
ferent types of bacteria cause some slightly different
symptoms. Patients infected with B. henselaealso expe-
rience blood-filled cysts within the liver and abnormal
liver function, whereas B. quintanapatients may have
tumor growths in the bone.
Diagnosis
This life-threatening but curable infection is often
misdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other con-
ditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma). A blood test devel-
oped in 1992 by the CDC detects antibodies to the bacte-
ria. It can be confirmed by reviewing symptoms, history

lymph glands. It isn’t necessary to biopsy a small sample
of the lymph node unless there is a question of cancerof
the lymph node or some other disease.
Treatment
Recent research indicates that antibioticsused to
treat other HIV opportunistic infections can both prevent
and treat bacillary angiomatosis. Treatment is usually
given until the lesions disappear, which typically takes
three or four weeks. A severely affected lymph node or
blister may have to be drained, and a heating pad may
help swollen, tender lymph glands. Acetaminophen
(Tylenol) may relieve pain, aches, and fever over 101°F
(38.3°C).
Prognosis
In most cases, prompt antibiotic treatment in
patients with AIDS cured the infection caused by either
variety of the bacteria, and patients may resume normal
life. Early diagnosis is crucial to a cure.
Prevention
Studies suggest that antibiotics may prevent the dis-
ease. Patients also should be sure to treat cats for fleas.

Bacteremia
Definition
Bacteremia is an invasion of the bloodstream by
bacteria.
Description
Bacteremia occurs when bacteria enter the blood-
stream. This may occur through a wound or infection, or
through a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremia
may cause no symptoms and resolve without treatment,
or it may produce feverand other symptoms of infection.
In some cases, bacteremia leads to septic shock, a poten-
tially life-threatening condition.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Several types of bacteria live on the surface of the
skin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,
lower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. These
bacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept in
check by the body’s natural barriers and the immune sys-
tem. People in good health with strong immune systems
rarely develop bacteremia. However, when bacteria are
introduced directly into the circulatory system, especial-
ly in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive med-
ical treatment, the immune system may not be able to
cope with the invasion, and symptoms of bacteremia may
develop. For this reason, bacteremia is most common in
people who are already affected by or being treated for
some other medical problem. In addition, medical treat-
ment may bring a person in contact with new types of
bacteria that are more invasive than those already resid-
ing in that person’s body, further increasing the likeli-
hood of bacterial infection.
Conditions which increase the chances of develop-
ing bacteremia include:
• immune suppression, either due to HIV infection or
drug therapy
• antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bacteri-
al types in the body
• prolonged or severe illness
• alcoholism or other drug abuse
• malnutrition
• diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in the
intestines, e.g. chemotherapyfor cancer
Common immediate causes of bacteremia include:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	435
Bacteremia
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 435  • drainage of an abscess, including an abscessed tooth.
• urinary tract infection, especially in the presence of a
bladder catheter.
• decubitus ulcers (pressure sores).
• intravenous procedures using unsterilized needles,
including IV drug use.
• prolonged IV needle placement.
• use of ostomytubes, including gastrostomy(surgically
making a new opening into the stomach), jejunostomy
(surgically making an opening from the abdominal wall
into the jejunum), and colostomy(surgically creating
an articifical opening into the colon).
The bacteria most likely to cause bacteremia include
members of the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudo-
monas, Haemophilus,and Esherichia coli(E. coli) genera.
Symptoms
Symptoms of bacteremia may include:
• fever over 101°F (38.3°C)
• chills
• malaise
• abdominal pain
• nausea
• vomiting
• diarrhea
• anxiety
• shortness of breath
• confusion
Not all of these symptoms are usually present. In the
elderly, confusion may be the only prominent symptom.
Bacteremia may lead to septic shock, whose symptoms
include decreased consciousness, rapid heart and breath-
ing rates and multiple organ failures.
Diagnosis
Bacteremia is diagnosed by culturing the blood for
bacteria. Samples may need to be tested several times
over several hours. Blood analysis may also reveal an
elevated number of white blood cells. Blood pressure is
monitored closely; a decline in blood pressure may indi-
cate the onset of septic shock.
Treatment
Antibioticsare the mainstay of treatment, and are
often begun before positive identification of the bacteria
is made. Close observation is required to guard against
KEY TERMS
Colostomy—Surgical creation of an artificial anus
on the abdominal wall by cutting into the colon
and bringing it up to the surface.
Gastrostomy—Surgical creation of an artificial
opening into the stomach through the abdominal
wall to allow tube feeding.
Jejunostomy—Surgical creation of an opening to
the middle portion of the small intestine

Septic shock—A life-threatening drop in blood
pressure caused by bacterial infection.
septic shock. Since bacteremia is usually associated with
an existing infection elsewhere in the body, finding and
treating this infection is an important part of treatment.
Bacteremia may cause no symptoms, but may be dis-
covered through a blood test for another condition. In this
situation, it may not need to be treated, except in patients
especially at risk for infection, such as those with heart
valve defects or whose immune systems are suppressed.
Prognosis
Prompt antibiotic therapy usually succeeds in clear-
ing bacteria from the bloodstream. Recurrence may indi-
cate an undiscovered site of infection. Untreated bacteria
in the blood may spread, causing infection of the heart
(endocarditisor pericarditis) or infection of the cover-
ing of the central nervous system (meningitis).
Prevention
Bacteremia can be prevented by preventing the
infections which often precede it. Good personal
hygiene, especially during viral illness, may reduce the
risk of developing bacterial infection. Treating bacterial
infections quickly and thoroughly can minimize the risk
of spreading infection. During medical procedures, the
burden falls on medical professionals to minimize the
number and duration of invasive procedures, to reduce
patients’ exposure to sources of bacteria when being
treated, and to use scrupulous technique.

Bad breath
Definition
Bad breath, sometimes called halitosis, is an
unpleasant odor of the breath.
Description
Bad breath is likely to be experienced by most adults
at least occasionally. Bad breath, either real or imagined,
can have a significant impact on a person’s social and
professional life.
Causes and symptoms
Bad breath can be caused by a number of problems.
Oral diseases, fermentation of food particles in the
mouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can all
contribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases, such
as lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver disease,
can also cause bad breath, though rarely. Many people
think that bad breath can originate in the stomach or
intestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual-
ly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carry
odor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breath
being caused from air continually escaping from the
stomach is remote. Cigarette smoke can cause bad
breath, not only in the cigarette smoker, but also in one
who is constantly exposed to second-hand smoke.
Diagnosis
The easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is
to ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete. This is
usually not too difficult. Another, more private, method of
determining if one has bad breath is to lick one’s wrist,
wait until it dries, then smell the area. Scraping the rear
area of the tongue with a plastic spoon, then smelling the
spoon, is another method one can use to assess bad breath.
KEY TERMS
Halitosis—The medical term for bad breath.
Treatment
The most effective treatment of bad breath is to treat
the cause. Poor oral hygienecan be improved by regular
brushing and flossing, as well as regular dental checkups.
Gentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oral
hygiene. In addition to good oral hygiene, the judicious
use of mouthwashes is helpful. Mouth dryness, experi-
enced at night or during fasting, or due to certain med-
ications and medical conditions, can contribute to bad
breath. Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequate
amounts of water. Chewing gum may be beneficial.
As mentioned, some medications, such as some high
blood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth. If this
problem is significant, a medication change, under the
supervision of one’s health care provider, may improve
the dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infections, once
diagnosed, can be treated medically, usually with antibi-
otics. Lung infections and kidney or liver problems will,
of course, need medical treatment
Alternative treatment
Depending on the cause, a multitude of alternative
therapeutic remedies can be used. For example,sinusitis
can be treated with steam inhalation of essential oils
and/or herbs.
Prognosis
Most bad breath can be treated successfully with
good oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally, for
patients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,
some delusional or obsessive behavior pattern might per-
tain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.

Balance and coordination tests
Definition
Balance is the ability to maintain a position. Coordi-
nation is the capacity to move through a complex set of
movements. Balance and coordination depend on the
interaction of multiple body organs and systems includ-
ing the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovas-
cular system, and muscles. Tests or examination of any
or all of these organs or systems may be necessary to
determine the causes of loss of balance,dizziness, or the
inability to coordinate movement or activities.
Purpose
Tests of balance and coordination, and the examina-
tion of the organs and systems that influence balance and
coordination, can help to identify causes of dizziness,
fainting, falling, or incoordination.
Precautions
Tests for balance and coordination should be con-
ducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will
not experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.
Description
Assessment of balance and coordination can include
discussion of the patient’s medical history and a com-
plete physical examinationincluding evaluation of the
heart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart rate, or
very low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory sys-
tem problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. Dur-
ing the examination, the patient may be asked to rotate
the head from side to side while sitting up or while lying
down with the head and neck extended over the edge of
the examination table. If these tests produce dizziness or
a rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystagmus), the
patient may have a disorder of the inner ear, which is
responsible for maintaining balance.
An examination of the eyes and ears may also give
clues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. The
patient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distant
point or object, and to look up, down, left, and right mov-
ing only the eyes while the eyes are examined. Problems
with vision may, in themselves, contribute to balance and	coordination disturbances, or may indicate more serious	problems of the nervous system or brain function. Hear-
ing loss, fluid in the inner ear, or ear infection might
indicate the cause of balance and coordination problems.
Various physical tests may also be used. A patient
may be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,
or touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance. The
patient may be asked to squeeze or push against the
doctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand on
tiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects of
these tests include holding positions for a certain num-
ber of seconds, successfully repeating movements a
certain number of times, and repeating the test accu-
rately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may also
be tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the knees,
ankles, and elbows with a small rubber mallet to test
nervous system functioning. These tests may reveal

could contribute to incoordination.
Preparation
No special preparation is required prior to adminis-
tration of balance and coordination tests. The patient
may be asked to disrobe and put on an examination gown
to make it easier for the doctor to observe muscles and
reflex responses.
Aftercare
No special aftercare is generally required, however,
some of the tests may cause episodes of dizziness or
incoordination. Patients may need to use caution in
returning to normal activities if they are experiencing any
symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness.
Risks
These simple tests of balance and coordination are
generally harmless.
Normal results
Under normal conditions, these test will not cause
dizziness, loss of balance, or incoordination.
Abnormal results
The presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, loss of
coordination, unusual eye movements, muscle weakness,
or impaired reflexes are abnormal results and may indi-
cate the problem causing the loss of balance or incoordi-
nation. In some cases, additional testing may be needed to
diagnose the cause of balance or coordination problems.

Altha Roberts EdgrenBalanitis
Definition
Balanitis is an inflammation of the head and fore-
skin of the penis.
Description
Balanitis generally affects uncircumcised males. These
are men who have a foreskin, which is the “hood” of soft
skin that partially covers the head of the penis. In balanitis,
the head and foreskin become red and inflamed. (In circum-
cised men, who lack a foreskin, these symptoms only affect
the tip of the penis.) The condition often occurs due to the
fungus Candida albicans, the same organism that causes
vaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is also
referred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a variety of
other fungal or bacterial infections, or may occur due to a
sensitivity reaction to common chemical agents.
Uncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis
due to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of the
foreskin around the top of the penis tends to create a
damp, warm environment that encourages the growth of
microorganisms. Most of the organisms associated with
balanitis are already present on the penis, but in very
small numbers. However, if the area between the head
and foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regular
basis, these organisms can multiply and lead to infection.
Diabetes can increase the risk of developing the con-
dition.
Causes and symptoms
Balanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for
example, neglecting to bathe for several days. A failure

al infections that cause the condition. In other cases, bal-
anitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some men
may be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps, laun-
dry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who con-
tract a sexually transmitted disease(STD) such as
trichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.
The symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore-
skin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only the
head is affected). These include redness, inflammation,
pain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty retract-
ing the foreskin.
Diagnosis
Balanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi-
cal examination. This may be conducted by your regular
health care provider or by a urologist, the type of doctor
who specializes in such disorders. The doctor may take a
sample of the discharge (if any) to determine the nature of
the possible infection. A urine test may be recommended
to evaluate glucose (sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitis
treatment is typically covered by medical insurance.
Treatment
The treatment of balanitis depends on the specific
cause, which can vary from case to case. Antibioticsare
used to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun-
gals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused by
Candida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the
goal is to identify the chemical agent responsible. Oint-
ments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.
No matter what the cause, it is important to thor-
oughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to allevi-
ate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring, or if the
inflammation is interfering with urination,circumcision
may be advised.
Alternative treatment
According to practitioners of alternative medicine,
certain herbs may be effective in controlling or prevent-
ing yeast infections—a common cause of balanitis.
These remedies include garlic, calendula, and gold-
enseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may also
help to clear up a Candidainfection.
Prognosis
Most cases go away quickly once the cause is identi-
fied and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis can
result in urethral stricture.
KEY TERMS
Acidophilus—A bacteria believed to combat yeast
infections.
Circumcision—The surgical removal of the fore-
skin.
Urethral stricture—A narrowing of the urethra
(urine tube).
Prevention
Proper hygiene is the best way to avoid balanitis.
Circumcision is sometimes performed to prevent repeat-
ed cases.

Balantidiasis
Definition
Balantidiasis is an infectious disease produced by a
single-celled microorganism (protozoan) called Balan-
tidium colithat infects the digestive tract. It is primarily a
disease of the tropics, although it is also found in cooler,
temperate climates. Most persons with balantidiasis do
not exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic),
but a few individuals will develop diarrheawith blood
and mucus and an inflamed colon (colitis).
Description
Balantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli, a para-
sitic protozoan that infects the large intestine. B. coliis

Balantidiasis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 440  the largest and only protozoan, having cilia or hair-like
structures, that is capable of causing disease in humans.
Balantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas with poor
sanitation and in settings where humans live in close
contact with pigs, sheep, or goats.
Causes and symptoms
Balantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating food
or drinking water that has been contaminated by human
or animal feces containing B. colicysts. During its life
cycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the
infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but
can survive outside the human body because of its thick,
protective covering; and the disease-producing form, the
trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot
survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot
infect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport-
ed to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken
open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho-
zoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho-
zoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by
invading the lining of the large intestine. Within the lining
of the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance
that destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) or
abscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts that
are carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the
feces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-
tions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to
months, ready to begin the cycle again.
Most individuals with balantidiasis have no notice-
able symptoms. Even though these individuals may not
feel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by per-
son-to-person contact or by contaminating food or water
with cysts that others may ingest, for example, by prepar-
ing food with unwashed hands.
The most common symptoms of balantidiasis are
chronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal cramps,
pain, and bloody stools. Complications may include
intestinal perforation in which the intestinal wall
becomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to other
parts of the body in the blood stream.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar dis-
eases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms may
or may not be present. A diagnosis of balantidiasis may be
considered when a patient has diarrhea combined with a
possible history of recent exposure to amebiasisthrough
travel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse.
Specifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by
finding B. colicysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stools
or by finding trophozoites in tissue samples (biopsy)
taken from the large bowel. A diagnostic blood test has
not yet been developed.
Stool examination
This test involves microscopically examining a stool
sample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of B.
coli.
Sigmoidoscopy
To take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a
procedure called a sigmoidoscopyis performed. During
a sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument is used to
visually examine the intestinal lining and obtain small
tissue specimens.
Treatment
Patients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip-
tion medication, typically consisting of a ten day course
of either tetracycline or metronidazole. Alternative drugs
that have proven effective in treating balantidiasis
include iodoquinol or paromomycin.
Prognosis
Although somewhat dependent on the patient’s over-
all health, in general, the prognosis for most patients with
balantidiasis is good. Severely infected patients occa-
sionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wall
(intestinal perforation) and consequent loss of blood.
Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medica-
tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-
vent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had the
disease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effec-
tive personal and community hygiene. Specific safe-
guards include the following:
• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified by
filtering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.
• Proper food handling. Measures include protecting
food from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-
ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and
before cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-
not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countries
with high rates of balantidiasis.
• Careful disposal of human feces.
• Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients. The
stools of family members and sexual partners of infect-
ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts or
trophozoites.

Balloon valvuloplasty
Definition
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a nar-
rowed heart valve is stretched open using a procedure
that does not require open heart surgery.
KEY TERMS
Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and
are usually capable of transmitting the disease but
who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are
said to be asymptomatic.
Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for diag-
nostic purposes.
Ciliated—Covered with short, hair-like protru-
sions, like B. coliand certain other protozoa. The
cilia or hairs help the organism to move.
Colitis—An inflammation of the large intestine
that occurs in some cases of balantidiasis. It is
marked by cramping pain and the passing of
bloody mucus.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism, such as B. coli, that is eukaryotic and,
therefore, different from bacteria (prokaryotic).
Sigmoidoscopy—A procedure in which a thin,
flexible, lighted instrument, called a sigmoido-
scope, is used to visually examine the lower part
of the large intestine.
Purpose
There are four valves in the heart, which are located
at the exit of each of the four chambers of the heart. They
are called aortic valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve,
and tricuspid valve. The valves open and close to regu-
late the blood flow from one chamber to the next. They
are vital to the efficient functioning of the heart.
In some people the valves are too narrow (a condi-
tion called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performed
on children and adults to improve valve function and
blood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treat-
ment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary stenosis. Balloon
valvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for nar-
rowed pulmonary valves. Results in treating narrowing
of the mitral valve are generally good. It is more difficult
to perform and less successful in treating narrowing of
the aortic valve.
Description
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thin
tube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at the tip
is inserted through the skin in the groin area into a blood
vessel, and then is threaded up to the opening of the nar-
rowed heart valve. The balloon is inflated, which stretch-
es the valve open. This procedure cures many valve
obstructions. It is also called balloon enlargement of a
narrowed heart valve.
The procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza-
tionlaboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is
usually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the area
where the catheter is inserted numb. After the site where the
catheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized, the
cardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood ves-
sel, then passes a balloon-tipped catheter through the first
catheter. Guided by a video monitor and an x ray, the physi-
cian slowly threads the catheter into the heart. The deflated
balloon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflated
repeatedly. The inflated balloon widens the valve’s opening
by splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve is
widened, the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The other
catheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in some
cases the procedure must be repeated.
Preparation
For at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty,
the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anything.
An intravenous line is inserted so that medications can be
administered. The patient’s groin area is shaved and
cleaned with an antiseptic. About an hour before the pro-
cedure, the patient is given an oral sedative such as
diazepam (Valium).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2442
Balloon valvuloplasty
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 442  Aftercare
After balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is sent to the
recovery room for several hours, where he or she is moni-
tored for vital signs (such as pulse and breathing) and heart
sounds. An electrocardiogram, which is a record of the
electrical impulses in the heart, is done. The leg in which
the catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented from
moving. The skin condition is monitored. The insertion
site, which will be covered by a sandbag, is observed for
bleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluids
will be given to help eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenous
blood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronary
arteries may be given. Painmedication is available.
For at least 30 minutes after removal of the catheter,
direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after this
a pressure dressing will be applied. Following discharge
from the hospital, the patient can usually resume normal
activities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong follow-up
is necessary because valves sometimes degenerate or
narrowing recurs, making surgery necessary.
Risks
Balloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica-
tions. For example, the valve can become misshapen so
that it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condi-
tion worse. Embolism, where pieces of the valve break
off and travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possible
risk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valve
leaflets, immediate surgery is required. Less frequent
complications are bleeding and hematoma (a local col-
lection of clotted blood) at the puncture site, abnormal
heart rhythms, reduced blood flow,heart attack, heart
puncture, infection, and circulatory problems.

Barbiturate-induced coma
Definition
A barbiturate-induced coma, or barb coma, is a tem-
porary state of unconsciousness brought on by a con-
trolled dose of a barbiturate drug, usually pentobarbital
or thiopental.
Purpose
Barbiturate comas are used to protect the brain dur-
ing major brain surgery, such as the removal of arteri-
ovenous malformationsor aneurysms. Coma may also
be induced to control intracranial hypertensioncaused
by brain injury.
Precautions
Barbiturate-induced comas are used when conven-
tional therapy to reduce intracranial hypertension has
failed. Barbiturate dosing is geared toward burst suppres-
sion—that is, reducing brain activity as measured by
electroencephalography. This reduction in brain activi-
ty has to be balanced against the potential side effects of
barbiturates, which include allergic reactions and
effects on the cardiovascular system.

Barbiturate-induced coma
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 443  Description
One of the greatest hazards associated with brain
injury is intracranial hypertension. Brain injury may be
caused by an accidental head injuryor a medical condi-
tion, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the brain
is injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing it to
swell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of the
brain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.
If the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood
may not reach all areas of the brain. Also, the brain tissue
may be forced against hard, bony edges on the interior of
the skull. In either case, the brain tissue may die, causing
permanent brain damage or death.
Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tis-
sue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these reduc-
tions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow, decreasing
the amount of swelling in the brain. With the swelling
relieved, the pressure decreases and some or all brain
damage may be averted.
Controversy exists, however, over the benefits of
using barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension.
Some studies have shown that barbiturate-induced coma
can reduce intracranial hypertension but does not neces-
KEY TERMS
Aneurysm—A bulge or sack-like projection from a
blood vessel.
Arteriovenous malformation—An abnormal tan-
gle of arteries and veins in which the arteries feed
directly into the veins without a normal interven-
ing capillary bed.
Diuretic agent—A drug which increases urine out-
put.
Electroencephalography—The recording of elec-
trical potentials produced by the brain. These
potentials indicate brain activity.
Hyperventilation—A respiratory therapy involving
deeper and/or faster breathing to keep the carbon
dioxide pressure in the blood below normal.
Intracranial hypertension—Abnormally high blood
pressure within the skull.
Osmotherapy—Intravenous injection or oral
administration of an agent that induces dehydra-
tion. The goal of dehydration is to reduce the
amount of accumulated fluid in the brain.
Steroid—A type of drug used to reduce swelling.
sarily prevent brain damage. Furthermore, the reduction
in intracranial hypertension may not be sustained.
Preparation
Inducing a barbiturate coma is usually kept in
reserve for cases in which conventional treatments for
controlling intracranial hypertension have failed.
Before coma is induced, intracranial hypertension may
be treated by hyperventilation; by facilitation of blood
flow from the brain; by decompressive surgical proce-
dures, such as draining excess fluids from under the
skull or from the chambers within the brain (ventricles);
or by drug therapy, including osmotherapy, diuretic
agents, or steroids.
Risks
An estimated 25% of barbiturate-induced comas are
accompanied by severe side effects. The side effects of
barbiturates, especially the depressive effect on the car-
diovascular system, can be too risky for some patients.
Other side effects include impaired gastrointestinal
motility and impaired immune response and infection.
Since barbiturates depress activity in the brain, measure-
ments of brain activity may be unreliable. Careful moni-
toring of the patient is required to ensure nutritional
needs are being met and to guard against complications,
such as lung infection, fevers, or deep vein blood clots.
Normal results
In many patients who do not respond to convention-
al therapy, barbiturate-induced coma can achieve the
necessary control of intracranial hypertension.

Definition
Barbiturates are medicines that act on the central ner-
vous system and cause drowsiness and can control seizures.
Purpose
Barbiturates are in the group of medicines known as
central nervous system depressants(CNS). Also known
as sedative-hypnotic drugs, barbiturates make people very
relaxed, calm, and sleepy. These drugs are sometimes
used to help patients relax before surgery. Some may also
be used to control seizures (convulsions). Although barbi-
turates have been used to treat nervousness and sleep
problems, they have generally been replaced by other
medicines for these purposes.
These medicines may become habit forming and
should not be used to relieve everyday anxietyand ten-
sion or to treat sleeplessness over long periods.
Description
Barbiturates are available only with a physician’s
prescription and are sold in capsule, tablet, liquid, and
injectable forms. Some commonly used barbiturates are
phenobarbital (Barbita) and secobarbital (Seconal).
Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of barbi-
turate and other factors such as the patient’s age and the
condition for which the medicine is being taken. Check
with the physician who prescribed the drug or the phar-
macist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take barbiturates exactly as directed. Never
take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the
drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does not
seem to be working, even after taking it for several
weeks, do not increase the dosage. Instead, check with
the physician who prescribed the medicine.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without
first checking with the physician who prescribed it. It
may be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce the
chance of withdrawal symptoms. If it is necessary to stop
taking the drug, check with the physician for instructions
on how to stop.
Precautions
See a physician regularly while taking barbiturates.
The physician will check to make sure the medicine is
working as it should and will note unwanted side effects.
Because barbiturates work on the central nervous
system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and other
drugs that slow the central nervous system, such as anti-
histamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids,
medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some painrelievers,
and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the effects
of anesthetics, including those used for dental proce-
dures. The combined effects of barbiturates and alcohol
or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central
nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to
unconsciousness or even death. Anyone taking barbitu-
rates should not drink alcohol and should check with his
or her physician before taking any medicines classified
as CNS depressants.
Taking an overdose of barbiturates or combining
barbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous system
depressants can cause unconsciousness and even death.
Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or a reaction to
combining barbiturates with alcohol or other drugs
should get emergency medical help immediately. Signs
include:
• severe drowsiness
• breathing problems
• slurred speech
• staggering
• slow heartbeat
• severe confusion
• severe weakness
Barbiturates may change the results of certain med-
ical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this
medicine should alert the health care professional in
charge.
People may feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less
alert when using these drugs. These effects may even
occur the morning after taking a barbiturate at bedtime.
Because of these possible effects, anyone who takes
these drugs should not drive, use machines or do any-
thing else that might be dangerous until they have found
out how the drugs affect them.
Barbiturates may cause physical or mental depen-
dence when taken over long periods. Anyone who shows
these signs of dependence should check with his or her
physician right away:
• the need to take larger and larger doses of the medicine
to get the same effect
• a strong desire to keep taking the medicine
• withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea or vom-
iting, convulsions, trembling, or sleep problems, when
the medicine is stopped

Barbiturates
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 445  Children may be especially sensitive to barbiturates.
This may increase the chance of side effects such as
unusual excitement.
Older people may also be more sensitive that others
to the effects of this medicine. In older people, barbitu-
rates may be more likely to cause confusion, depression,
and unusual excitement. These effects are also more like-
ly in people who are very ill.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take barbiturates. Before taking these drugs, be sure to let
the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to barbiturates in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes,
preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Taking barbiturates during pregnancy
increases the chance of birth defectsand may cause
other problems such as prolonged labor and withdrawal
effects in the baby after birth. Pregnant women who must
take barbiturates for serious or life-threatening condi-
tions should thoroughly discuss with their physicians the
benefits and risks of taking this medicine.
BREASTFEEDING.Barbiturates pass into breast milk
and may cause problems such as drowsiness, breathing
problems, or slow heartbeat in nursing babies whose
mothers take the medicine. Women who are breastfeed-
ing should check with their physicians before using bar-
biturates.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using barbi-
turates, people with any of these medical problems should
make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:
• alcohol or drug abuse
• depression
• hyperactivity (in children)
• pain
• kidney disease
• liver disease
• diabetes
• overactive thyroid
• underactive adrenal gland
• chronic lung diseases such as asthmaor emphysema
• severe anemia
• porphyria
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking barbiturates
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, light-
headedness, drowsiness, and clumsiness or unsteadiness.
These problems usually go away as the body adjusts to
the drug and do not require medical treatment unless they
persist or interfere with normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check with
the physician who prescribed the medicine immediately:
•fever
• muscle or joint pain
• sore throat
• chest pain or tightness in the chest
• wheezing
• skin problems, such as rash,hives, or red, thickened, or
scaly skin
• bleeding sores on the lips
• sores or painful white spots in the mouth
• swollen eyelids, face, or lips
In addition, check with a physician as soon as possi-
ble if confusion, depression, or unusual excitement occur
after taking barbiturates.
Patients who take barbiturates for a long time or at
high doses may notice side effects for some time after
they stop taking the drug. These effects usually appear
within 8-16 hours after the patient stops taking the medi-
cine. Check with a physician if these or other trouble-
some symptoms occur after stopping treatment with bar-
biturates:
• dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness
• anxiety or restlessness
•hallucinations
• vision problems
• nausea and vomiting
• seizures (convulsions)
• muscle twitches or trembling hands
• weakness
• sleep problems, nightmares, or increased dreaming
Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms during or after treatment with barbitu-
rates should get in touch with his or her physician.

Birth control pills may not work properly when
taken while barbiturates are being taken. To prevent
pregnancy, use additional or additional methods of birth
control while taking barbiturates.
Barbiturates may also interact with other medicines.
When this happens, the effects of one or both of the
drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes barbiturates should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with barbiturates are:
• Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such
as medicine for allergies, colds, hay fever, and asthma;
sedatives; tranquilizers; prescription pain medicine;
muscle relaxants; medicine for seizures; sleep aids; bar-
biturates; and anesthetics.

Barium enema
Definition
A barium enema, also known as a lower GI (gastroin-
testinal) exam, is a test that uses x-ray examination to
view the large intestine. There are two types of this test:
the single-contrast technique where barium sulfate is
injected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view of
the large intestine; and the double-contrast (or “air con-
trast”) technique where air is inserted into the rectum.
Purpose
A barium enema may be performed for a variety of
reasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon and
rectal cancer(or colorectal cancer), and inflammatory
disease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the tis-
sue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a pouch
pushing out from the colon), and structural changes in
the large intestine can also be established with this test.
The double-contrast barium enema is the best method for
detecting small tumors (such as polyps), early inflamma-
tory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.
The decision to perform a barium enema is based on a
person’s history of altered bowel habits. These can include
diarrhea,constipation, any lower abdominal painthey
are currently exhibiting, blood, mucus, or pus in their
stools. It is also recommended that this exam be used every
five to 10 years to screen healthy people for colorectal can-
cer, the second most deadly type of tumor in the United
States. Those who have a close relative with colorectal can-
cer or have had a precancerous polyp are considered to be

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 447  at an increased risk for the disease and should be screened
more frequently to look for abnormalities.
Precautions
While barium enema is an effective screening
method in the detection of symptoms and may lead to a
timely diagnosis of several diseases, it is not the only
method to do this. As of 1997, some studies have shown
that the colonoscopyprocedure performed by experi-
enced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diag-
nostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer.
A colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physi-
cian to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps. If
abnormalities are seen at this time the procedure is
accompanied by a biopsy. Some physicians use sigmoi-
doscopyplus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy.
Description
To begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with
their back down on a tilting radiographic table in order to
have x rays of the abdomen taken. After being assisted to
a different position, a well-lubricated rectal tube is insert-
ed through the anus. This tube allows the physician or
assistant to slowly administer the barium into the intes-
tine. While this filling process is closely monitored, it is
important for the patient to keep the anus tightly con-
tracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its posi-
tion and prevent the barium from leaking. This step is
emphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that may
be caused if the barium leaks. A rectal balloon may also
be inflated to help retain the barium. The table may be
tilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid in
the filling process.
As the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomen
are taken to distinguish significant findings.There are many
ways to perform a barium enema. One way is that shortly
after filling, the rectal tube is removed and the patient
expels as much of the barium as possible. Upon completing
this, an additional x ray is taken,and a double-contrast
enema may follow. If this is done immediately, a thin
film of barium will remain in the intestine, and air is
then slowly injected to expand the bowel lumen.
Sometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air is
injected.
Preparation
In order to conduct the most accurate barium enema
test, the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowel
preparation instructions prior to the test. This preparation
commonly includes restricted intake of diary products
and a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the test, in addition
to drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids 12–24
hours before the test. Patients may also be given laxa-
tives, and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema.
In addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara-
tion prior to the test, the patient can expect the following
during a barium enema:
• They will be well draped with a gown as they are
secured to a tilting x-ray table.
• As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, they
may experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate.
• The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep breaths
through the mouth to ease any discomfort.
Aftercare
Patients should follow several steps immediately
after undergoing a barium enema, including:
• Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat-
ing effects of bowel preparation and the test.
• Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel prepa-
ration taken before it can be exhausting.
• A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any
remaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be preva-
lent for the next 24-72 hours following the test.
Risks
While a barium enema is considered a safe screen-
ing test used on a routine basis, it can cause complica-
tions in certain people. The following indications should
be kept in mind before a barium enema is performed:
• Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerative
colitis, toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation in
the intestine should not undergo a barium enema.
• The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has a
blocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or
severe bloody diarrhea.
• Complications that may be caused by the test include
perforation of the colon, water intoxication, barium
granulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction.
These are all very rare.
Normal results
When the patient undergoes a single-contrast enema,
their intestine is steadily filled with barium to differenti-
ate the colon’s markings. A normal result displays uni-
form filling of the colon. As the barium is expelled, the
intestinal walls collapse. A normal result on the x ray
after defecation will show the intestinal lining as having
a standard, feathery appearance.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2448
Barium enema
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 448  Accordingly, the double-contrast enema expands the
intestine which is already lined with a thin layer of bari-
um, but with air to display a detailed image of the
mucosal pattern. Varying positions taken by the patient
allow the barium to collect on the dependent walls of the
intestine by way of gravity.
Abnormal results
A barium enema allows abnormalities to appear on an
x ray that may aid in the diagnosis of several different con-
ditions. Although most colon cancers occur in the rectosig-
moid region, or upper part of the rectum and adjoining
portion of the sigmoid colon, and are better detected with a
different test called a proctosigmoidoscopy, an enema can
identify other early signs of cancer.
Identification of polyps, diverticulosis, inflammato-
ry disease, such as diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis is
attainable through a barium x ray. Structural changes in
the intestine,gastroenteritis, and some cases of acute
appendicitismay also be apparent by viewing this x ray.

Bartholin’s gland cyst
Definition
A Bartholin’s gland cyst is a swollen fluid-filled lump
that develops from a blockage of one of the Bartholin’s
glands, which are small glands located on each side of the
opening to the vagina. Bartholin’s gland cysts and abscess-
es are commonly found in women of reproductive age,
developing in approximately 2% of all women.
Description
The Bartholin’s glands are located in the lips of the
labia that cover the vaginal opening. The glands (normal-
ly the size of a pea) provide moisture for the vulva area.
A Bartholin’s gland cyst may form in the gland itself or
in the duct draining the gland. A cyst normally does not
cause pain, grows slowly, and may go away without
treatment. It usually ranges in size from 0.4-1.2 in (1–3
cm), although some may grow much larger.
If infected, a Bartholin’s gland cyst can form an
abscessthat will increase in size over several days and is
very painful. In order to heal, a Bartholin’s gland cyst
usually must be drained.
Causes and symptoms
A Bartholin’s gland cyst occurs if the duct becomes
blocked for any reason, such as infection, injury, or
chronic inflammation. Very rarely a cyst is caused by
cancer, which usually occurs only in women over the
age of 40. In many cases, the cause of a Bartholin’s gland
cyst is unknown.
Symptoms of an uninfected Bartholin’s gland cyst
include a painless lump on one side of the vulva area
(most common symptom) and redness or swelling in the
vulva area.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	449
Bartholin’s gland cyst
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 449  Symptoms of an abscessed Bartholin’s gland include:
• pain that occurs with walking, sitting, physical activity,
or sexual intercourse
• fever and chills
• increased swelling in the vulva area over a two- to four-
day period
• drainage from the cyst, normally occurring four to five
days after the swelling starts
Abscesses may be caused by sexually transmitted
bacteria, such as those causing chlamydial or gonococcal
infections, while others are caused by bacteria normally
occurring in the vagina. Over 60 types of bacteria have
been found in Bartholin’s gland abscesses.
Diagnosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst or abscess is diagnosed by
a gynecological pelvic exam. If the cyst appears to be
infected, a culture is often performed to identify the type
of bacteria causing the abscess.
Treatment
Treatment for this condition depends on the size of
the cyst, whether it is painful, and whether the cyst is
infected.
If the cyst is not infected, treatment options include:
• watchful waiting by the woman and her health care pro-
fessional
• soaking of the genital area with warm towel compresses
• soaking of the genital area in a sitz bath
KEY TERMS
Marsupialization—Cutting out a wedge of the cyst
wall and putting in stitches so the cyst cannot
reoccur.
Sitz bath—A warm bath in which just the buttocks
and genital area soak in water; used to reduce
pain and aid healing in the genital area.
Window operation—Cutting out a large oval-
shaped piece of the cyst wall and putting in stitch-
es to create a window so the cyst cannot reoccur.
Word catheter—A small rubber catheter with an
inflatable balloon tip that is inserted into a stab
incision in the cyst, after the contents of the cyst
have been drained.
• use of non-prescription pain medication to relieve mild
discomfort
If the Bartholin’s gland is infected, there are several
treatments available to treat the abscess, including:
• soaking of the genital area in a sitz bath
• treatment with antibiotics
• use of prescription or non-prescription pain medication
• incision and drainage, i.e., cutting into the cyst and
draining the fluid (not usually successful, as the cyst
often reoccurs)
• placement of a drain (Word catheter) in the cyst for two
to four weeks so fluid can drain and prevent reoccur-
rence of the cyst
• marsupialization
• window operation
• use of a carbon dioxide laser to open the cyst and heat
the cyst wall tissue so that the cyst cannot form a sac
and reoccur
• incision and drainage, followed by treatment with silver
nitrate to burn the cyst wall so the cyst cannot form a
sac and reoccur
• removal of the entire Bartholin’s gland cyst, if the cyst
has reoccurred several times after use of other treatment
methods
During surgical treatment, the area will be numbed
with a local anesthetic to reduce pain. General anesthesia
may be used for treatment of an abscess, as the procedure
can be painful.
In a pregnant woman, surgical treatment of cysts
that are asymptomatic should be delayed until after
delivery to avoid the possibility of excessive bleeding.
However, if the Bartholin’s gland is infected and must
be drained, antibiotics and local anesthesia are generally
considered safe.
If the cyst is caused by cancer, the gland must be
excised, and the woman should be under the care of a
gynecologist familiar with the treatment of this type of
cancer.
Alternative treatment
If a Bartholin’s gland cyst has no or mild symptoms,
or has opened on its own to drain, a woman may decide
to use watchful waiting, warm sitz baths, and non-pre-
scription pain medication. If symptoms become worse or
do not improve, a health care professional should then be
consulted.
Infected Bartholin’s glands should be evaluated and
treated by a health care professional.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2450
Bartholin’s gland cyst
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 450  Prognosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst should respond to treatment
in a few days. If an abscess requires surgery, healing may
take days to weeks, depending on the size of the abscess
and the type of surgical procedure used. Most of the sur-
gical procedures, except for incision and drainage,
should be effective in preventing recurring infections.
Prevention
There are few ways to prevent the formation of
Bartholin’s gland cysts or abscesses. However, as a
Bartholin’s gland abscess may be caused by a sexually
transmitted disease, the practice of safe sex is recommend-
ed. Using good hygiene, i.e., wiping front to back after a
bowel movement, is also recommended to prevent bacteria
from the bowels from contaminating the vaginal area.

Bartonellosis
Bartonellosis
Definition
Bartonellosis is an infectious bacterial disease with
an acute form (which has a sudden onset and short
course) and a chronic form (which has more gradual
onset and longer duration). The disease is transmitted by
sandflies and occurs in western South America. Charac-
terized by a form of red blood cell deficiency (hemolytic
anemia) and fever, the potentially fatal acute form is
called Oroya fever or Carrion’s disease. The chronic
form is identified by painful skin lesions.
Description
The acute form of the disease gets its name from an
outbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru.
KEY TERMS
Acute—Referring to the course of a disease, or a
phase of a disease, the short-term experience of
prominent symptoms.
Chronic—Referring to the course of a disease, or a
phase of a disease, the long-term experience of
prominent symptoms.
Erythrocytes—Red blood cells.
Hemolytic anemia—A form of erythrocyte deficien-
cy caused by the destruction of the red blood cells.
Host—The organism that harbors or nourishes
another organism (parasite). In bartonellosis, the
person infected with Bartonella basilliformis.
Vector—An organism, such as insects or rodents,
that can transmit disease to humans.
More than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors later
developed a skin disease, called verruga peruana (Peru-
vian warts). These skin lesions were observed prior to
the 1871 outbreak—perhaps as far back as the pre-
Columbian era—but a connection to Oroya fever was
unknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, Daniel
Carrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion to
study the course of the skin disease. When he became ill
with Oroya fever, the connection became apparent.
Oroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease in honor of
his fatal experiment.
The bacteria,Bartonella bacilliformis, was isolated
by Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as the
cause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonellagenus
includes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which cause
human diseases, including cat-scratch diseaseand
bacillary angiomatosis. However, bartonellosis refers
exclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis. The
disease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountains
in western South America; nearly all cases have been in
Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involving
thousands of people occurred in 1940–41, but bartonel-
losis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sand-
flies, the only known disease carrier (vector), has been
credited with managing the disease.
Causes and symptoms
Bartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal sandfly
and arises from infection with B. bacilliformis. The sand-
fly,Lutzomyia verrucarum, dines on human blood and,
in so doing, can inject bacteria into the bloodstream. The
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	451
Bartonellosis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 451  sandfly is found only in certain areas of the Peruvian
Andes; other, as-yet-unidentified vectors are suspected in
Ecuador and Colombia.
Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria latch onto red
blood cells (erythrocytes), burrow into the cells, and
reproduce. In the process, up to 90% of the host’s ery-
throcytes are destroyed, causing severe hemolytic ane-
mia. The anemia is accompanied by high fever, muscle
and joint pain,delirium, and possibly coma.
Two to eight weeks after the acute phase, an infected
individual develops verruga peruana. However, individu-
als may exhibit the characteristic lesions without ever
experiencing the acute phase. Left untreated, the lesions
may last months or years. These lesions resemble blood-
filled blisters, up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in diameter, and appear
primarily on the head and limbs. They can be painful to
the touch and may bleed or ulcerate.
Diagnosis
Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the
patient’s history, such as recent travel in areas where bar-
tonellosis occurs. Isolationof B. bacilliformisfrom the
bloodstream or lesions can confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Antibioticsare the mainstay of bartonellosis treat-
ment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics,
including chloramphenicol,penicillins, and aminogly-
cosides. Blood transfusions may be necessary to treat the
anemia caused by bartonellosis.
Prognosis
Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatality
associated with bartonellosis. Prior to the development of
antibiotics, the fever was fatal in 40% of cases. With
antibiotic treatment, that rate has dropped to 8%. Fatali-
ties can result from complications associated with severe
anemia and secondary infections. Once the infection is
halted, an individual can recover fully.
Prevention
Avoiding sandfly bites is the primary means of pre-
vention. Sandfly eradication programs have been helpful
in decreasing the sandfly population, and insect repellant
can be effective in preventing sandfly bites.

Battered child syndrome
Definition
Battered child syndrome refers to injuries sustained
by a child as a result of physical abuse, usually inflicted
by an adult caregiver. Alternative terms include: shaken
baby; shaken baby syndrome; child abuse; and non-
accidental trauma (NAT).
Description
Internal injuries, cuts,burns,bruisesand broken or
fractured bones are all possible signs of battered child
syndrome. Emotional damage to a child is also often the
by-product of child abuse, which can result in serious
behavioral problems such as substance abuse or the
physical abuse of others. Approximately 14% of children
in the United States are physically abused each year, and
an estimated 2,000 of those children die as a result of the
abuse. Between 1994–1995, 1.1 million cases of child
abuse were recorded in the United States; of that number,
55% of the victims were less than a year old.
Causes and symptoms
Battered child syndrome (BCS) is found at every
level of society, although the incidence may be higher in
low-income households where adult caregivers suffer
greater stressand social difficulties, without having had
the benefit of higher education. The child abuser most
often injures a child in the heat of anger, and was often
abused as a child himself. The incessant crying of an

Battered child syndrome
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 452  infant or child may trigger abuse. Symptoms may include
a delayed visit to the emergency room with an injured
child; an implausible explanation of the cause of a child’s
injury; bruises that match the shape of a hand, fist or belt;
cigarette burns; scald marks; bite marks; black eyes;
unconsciousness; bruises around the neck; and a bulging
fontanel in infants.
Diagnosis
Battered child syndrome is most often diagnosed by
an emergency room physician or pediatrician, or by
teachers or social workers. Physical examinationwill
detect bruises, burns, swelling, retinal hemorrhages. X
rays, and other imaging techniques, such as MRI or scans
may confirm fracturesor other internal injuries. The
presence of injuries at different stages of healing (i.e.
having occurred at different times)is nearly always
indicative of BCS. Establishing the diagnosis is often
hindered by the excessive cautiousness of caregivers or
by actual concealment of the true origin of the child˛s
injuries, as a result of fear, shame and avoidance or
denial mechanisms.
Treatment
Medical treatment for battered child syndrome will
vary according to the type of injury incurred. Counseling
and the implementation of an intervention plan for the
child’s parents or guardians is necessary. The child abuser
may be incarcerated, and/or the abused child removed
from the home to prevent further harm. Reporting child
abuse to authorities is mandatory for doctors, teachers,
and childcare workers in most states as a way to prevent
continued abuse. Both physical and psychological therapy
are often recommended as treatment for the abused child.
Prognosis
The prognosis for battered child syndrome will
depend on the severity of injury, actions taken by the
authorities to ensure the future safety of the injured child,
and the willingness of parents or guardians to seek coun-
seling for themselves as well as for the child.
Prevention
Recognizing the potential for child abuse in a situa-
tion, and the seeking or offering of intervention and
counseling before battered child syndrome occurs is the
best way to prevent it. Signs that physical abuse may be
forthcoming include parental alcohol or substance abuse;
previous abuse of the child or the child’s siblings; history
of mental or emotional problems in parents; parents

Bed-wetting
Definition
Bed-wetting is the unintentional (involuntary) dis-
charge of urine during the night. Although most children
between the ages of three and five begin to stay dry at
night, the age at which children are physically and emo-
tionally ready to maintain complete bladder control
varies. Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the con-
tinued, usually involuntary, passage of urine during the
night or the day after the age at which control is expected.
Description
Most children wet the bed occasionally, and defini-
tions of the age and frequency at which bed-wetting
becomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Many
researchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	453
Bed-wetting
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 453  About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about
once a month. More boys than girls have this problem.
The American Psychiatric Association, however, defines
enuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed or
clothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually invol-
untary but in some cases it is intentional. For a diagnosis
of enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week for at least
three months with no underlying physiological cause.
Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and daytime (diur-
nal), at age five affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls. By
age 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of girls; only 1% of
adolescents experience enuresis.
Enuresis is divided into two classes. A child with
primary enuresis has never established bladder control. A
child with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a pro-
longed dry period. Some children have both nocturnal
and diurnal enuresis.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known. It
tends to run in families. Most children with primary enure-
sis have a close relative—a parent, aunt, or uncle—who
also had the disorder. About 70% of children with two par-
ents who wet the bed will also wet the bed. Twin studies
have shown that both of a pair of identical twins experience
enuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins.
Sometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious
medical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or
epilepsy. Snoringand episodes of interrupted breathing
during sleep (sleep apnea) occasionally contribute to
bed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can cause
these conditions. Other physiological problems, such as
urinary tract infection, severe constipation, or spinal
cord injury, can cause bed-wetting.
Children who wet the bed frequently may have a
smaller than normal functional bladder capacity. Func-
tional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a person
can hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge to
urinate. When functional capacity is small, the bladder
will not hold all the urine produced during the night.
Tests have shown that bladder size in these children is
normal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strong
urges to urinate. Such children urinate often during the
daytime and may wet several times at night. Although a
small functional bladder capacity may be caused by a
developmental delay, it may also be that the child’s habit
of voiding frequently slows bladder development.
Parents often report that their bed-wetting child is an
extremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake. However,
several research studies found that bed-wetting children
have normal sleep patterns and that bed-wetting can
occur in any stage of sleep.
Recent medical research has found that many chil-
dren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an impor-
tant hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
ADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hours,
meaning that the urine contains less water and therefore
takes up less space. This decreased volume of water usu-
ally prevents the child’s bladder from overfilling during
the night, unless the child drank a lot just before going to
bed. Testing of many bed-wetting children has shown
that these children do not have the usual increase in ADH
during sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, often
produce more urine during the hours of sleep than their
bladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the bladder
releases the excess urine and the child wets the bed.
Research demonstrates that in most cases bed-wet-
ting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psy-
chological problem. Children who wet the bed usually
have normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that
are no different from those of non-bed-wetting children.
Sometimes emotional stress, such as the birth of a sib-
ling, a deathin the family, or separation from the family,
may be associated with the onset of bed-wetting in a pre-
viously toilet-trained child. Daytime wetting, however,
may indicate that the problem has a physical cause.
While most children have no long-term problems as
a result of bed-wetting, some children may develop psy-
chological problems. Low self-esteem may occur when
these children, who already feel embarrassed, are further
humiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punish
them or who are overly aggressive about toilet training.
The problem can by aggravated when playmates tease or
when social activities such as sleep-away camp are
avoided for fear of teasing.
Diagnosis
If a child continues to wet the bed after the age of
six, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation and
diagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist
(pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can make a
diagnosis, a thorough medical history is obtained. Then
the child receives a physical examination, appropriate
laboratory tests, including a urine test (urinalysis), and,
if necessary, radiologic studies (such as x rays).
If the child is healthy and no physical problem is found,
which is the case 90% of the time, the doctor may not rec-
ommend treatment but rather may provide the parents and
the child with reassurance, information, and advice.
Treatment
Occasionally a doctor will determine that the prob-
lem is serious enough to require treatment. Standard
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2454
Bed-wetting
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 454  treatments for bed-wetting include bladder training
exercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy-
chotherapy, and diet therapy.
Bladder training exercises are based on the theory
that those who wet the bed have small functional bladder
capacity. Children are told to drink a large quantity of
water and to try to prolong the periods between urina-
tions. These exercises are designed to increase bladder
capacity but are only successful in resolving bed-wetting
in a small number of patients.
In motivational therapy, parents attempt to encour-
age the child to combat bed-wetting, but the child must
want to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such as
praise or rewards for staying dry, can help improve self-
image and resolve the condition. Punishment for “wet”
nights will hamper the child’s self-esteem and compound
the problem.
The following motivational techniques are common-
ly used:
• Behavior modification. This method of therapy is
aimed at helping children take responsibility for their
nighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors.
For example, children are taught to use the bathroom
before bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after din-
ner. While behavior modification generally produces
good results, it is long-term treatment.
• Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed in
the child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor triggers
an alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wet-
ness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then go to
the bathroom and finish urinating. The intention is to
condition a response to awaken when the bladder is
full. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation of both
parents and children. They are considered the most
effective form of treatment now available.
A number of drugs are also used to treat bed-wetting.
These medications are usually fast acting; children often
respond to them within the first week of treatment. Among
the drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmo-
pressin acetate (DDAVP), a substance similar to the hor-
mone that helps regulate urine production; and imipramine
hydrochloride, a drug that helps to increase bladder capac-
ity. Studies show that imipramine is effective for as many
as 50% of patients. However, children often wet the bed
again after the drug is discontinued, and it has some side
effects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physical
cause can be treated by surgical procedures. These causes
include enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea, physical
defects in the urinary system, or a spinal tumor.
Psychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits
signs of severe emotional distress in response to events
such as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a
change in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also indi-
cated if a child shows signs of persistently low self-
esteem or depression.
In rare cases,allergiesor intolerances to certain
foods—such as dairy products, citrus products, or choco-
late—can cause bed-wetting. When children have food
sensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discovering
the substances that trigger the allergic response and elim-
inating these substances from the child’s diet.
Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments are available for
bed-wetting.
Massage
According to practitioners of this technique, pres-
sure applied to various points on the body may help alle-
viate the condition. Acupressureor massage, when done
by a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-wetting
caused by a neurologic problem.
Herbal and homeopathic remedies
Some herbal remedies, such as horsetail (Equisetum
arvense) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A
trained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti-
tutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vital
force, eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wet-
ting. Common homeopathic remedies used in this treat-
ment include Causticum, Lycopodium,and Pulsatilla.
Hypnosis
Hypnosis is another approach that is being used suc-
cessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It trains
the child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his or
her bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less expensive, less
time-consuming, and less dangerous than most
approaches; it has virtually no side effects. Recent med-
ical studies show that hypnotherapycan work quickly—
within four to six sessions.
Prognosis
Occasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does
not have a “cure.” If the child has no underlying physical
or psychological problem that is causing the bed-wetting,
in most cases he or she will outgrow the condition with-
out treatment. About 15% of bedwetters become dry each
year after age 6. If bed-wetting is frequent, accompanied
by daytime wetting, or falls into the American Psychiatric
Association’s diagnostic definition of enuresis, a doctor
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	455
Bed-wetting
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 455  should be consulted. If treatment is indicated, it usually
successfully resolves the problem. Marked improvement
is seen in about 75% of cases treated with wetness alarms.
Prevention
Although preventing a child from wetting the bed is
not always possible, parents can take steps to help the
child keep the bed dry at night. These steps include:
• Encouraging and praising the child for staying dry
instead of punishing when the child wets.
• Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, if
he or she feels the need.
• Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before bed-
time.

Bedsores
Definition
Bedsores are also called decubitus ulcers, pressure
ulcers, or pressure sores. These tender or inflamed patch-
es develop when skin covering a weight-bearing part of
the body is squeezed between bone and another body
part, or a bed, chair, splint, or other hard object.
Description
Each year, about one million people in the United
States develop bedsores ranging from mild inflammation
to deep woundsthat involve muscle and bone. This often
painful condition usually starts with shiny red skin that
quickly blisters and deteriorates into open sores that can
harbor life-threatening infection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2456
Bedsores
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 456  Bedsores are not cancerous or contagious. They are
most likely to occur in people who must use wheelchairs
or who are confined to bed. In 1992, the federal Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research reported that bed-
sores afflict:
• 10% of hospital patients
• 25% of nursing home residents
• 60% of quadriplegics
The Agency also noted that 65% of elderly people
hospitalized with broken hips develop bedsores and that
doctors fees for treatment of bedsores amounted to
$2,900 per person.
Bedsores are most apt to develop on the:
• ankles
• back of the head
• heels
• hips
• knees
• lower back
• shoulder blades
• spine
People over the age of 60 are more likely than younger
people to develop bedsores. Risk is also increased by:
• atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries)
• diabetes or other conditions that make skin more sus-
ceptible to infection
• diminished sensation or lack of feeling
• heart problems
• incontinence (inability to control bladder or bowel
movements)
• malnutrition
• obesity
• paralysis or immobility
• poor circulation
• prolonged bed rest, especially in unsanitary conditions
or with wet or wrinkled sheets
• spinal cord injury
Causes and symptoms
Bedsores most often develop when constant pressure
pinches tiny blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutri-
ents to the skin. When skin is deprived of oxygen and
nutrients for as little as an hour, areas of tissue can die
and bedsores can form.
Slight rubbing or friction against the skin can cause
minor pressure ulcers. They can also develop when a
patient stretches or bends blood vessels by slipping into a
different position in a bed or chair.
Urine, feces, or other moisture increases the risk of
skin infection, and people who are unable to move or rec-
ognize internal cues to shift position have a greater than
average risk of developing bedsores.
Other risk factors include:
• malnutrition
• anemia (lack of red blood cells)
• diuse atrophy (muscle loss or weakness from lack of
use)
• infection
Diagnosis
Physical examination, medical history, and patient
and caregiver observations are the basis of diagnosis.
Special attention must be paid to physical or mental
problems, like incontinence or confusion, that could
complicate a patient’s recovery.
Bedsores usually follow six stages:
• redness of skin
• redness, swelling, and possible peeling of outer layer of
skin
• dead skin, draining wound, and exposed layer of fat
• tissue deaththrough skin and fat, to muscle
• inner fat and muscle death
• destruction of bone, bone, infection, fracture, and blood
infection

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 457  Treatment
Prompt medical attention can prevent surface pres-
sure sores from deepening into more serious infections.
For mild bedsores, treatment involves relieving pressure,
keeping the wound clean and moist, and keeping the area
around the ulcer clean and dry. Antiseptics, harsh soaps,
and other skin cleansers can damage new tissue, so a
saline solution should be used to cleanse the wound
whenever a fresh non-stick dressing is applied.
The patient’s doctor may prescribe infection-fight-
ing antibiotics, special dressings or drying agents, or
lotions or ointments to be applied to the wound in a thin
film three or four times a day. Warm whirlpool treat-
ments are sometimes recommended for sores on the arm,
hand, foot, or leg.
In a procedure called debriding, a scalpel may be
used to remove dead tissue or other debris from the
wound. Deep, ulcerated sores that don’t respond to other
therapy may require skin grafts or plastic surgery.
A doctor should be notified whenever a person:
• will be bedridden or immobilized for an extended time
• is very weak or unable to move
• develops bedsores
Immediate medical attention is required whenever:
• skin turns black or becomes inflamed, tender, swollen,
or warm to the touch.
• the patient develops a feverduring treatment.
• the sore contains pus or has a foul-smelling discharge.
With proper treatment, bedsores should begin to heal
two to four weeks after treatment begins.
Alternative treatment
Zinc and vitaminsA, C, E, and B complex help skin
repair injuries and stay healthy, but large doses of vita-
mins or mineralsshould never be used without a doc-
tor’s approval.
A poultice made of equal parts of powdered slippery
elm (Ulmus fulva), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis),
and echinacea(Echinaceaspp.) blended with a small
amount of hot water can relieve minor inflammation. An
infection-fighting rinse can be made by diluting two
drops of essential tea tree oil (Melaleucaspp.) in eight
ounces of water. An herbal tea made from the calendula
(Calendula officinalis) can act as an antiseptic and
wound healing agent. Calendula cream can also be used.
Contrasting hot and cold local applications can
increase circulation to the area and help flush out waste
products, speeding the healing process. The temperatures
should be extreme (hot hot and ice cold), yet tolerable to
the skin. Hot compresses should be applied for three
minutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold compress appli-
cation, repeating the cycle three times. The cycle should
always end with the cold compress.
Prevention
It is usually possible to prevent bedsores from devel-
oping or worsening. The patient should be inspected reg-
ularly; should bathe or shower every day, using warm
water and mild soap; and should avoid cold or dry air. A
bedridden patient should be repositioned at least once
every two hours while awake. A person who uses a
wheelchair should shift his weight every 10 or 15 min-
utes, or be helped to reposition himself at least once an
hour. It is important to lift, rather than drag, a person
being repositioned. Bony parts of the body should not be
massaged. Even slight friction can remove the top layer
of skin and damage blood vessels beneath it.
If the patient is bedridden, sensitive body parts can
be protected by:
• sheepskin pads
• special cushions placed on top of a mattress
• a water-filled mattress
• a variable-pressure mattress whose sections can be
individually inflated or deflated to redistribute pressure
Pillows or foam wedges can prevent a bedridden
patient’s ankles from irritating each other, and pillows
placed under the legs from mid-calf to ankle can raise the
heels off the bed. Raising the head of the bed slightly and
briefly can provide relief, but raising the head of the bed
more than 30 degrees can cause the patient to slide,
thereby causing damage to skin and tiny blood vessels.
A person who uses a wheelchair should be encour-
aged to sit up as straight as possible. Pillows behind the
head and between the legs can help prevent bedsores, as
can a special cushion placed on the chair seat. Donut-
shaped cushions should not be used because they restrict
blood flow and cause tissues to swell.
Prognosis
Bedsores can usually be cured, but about 60,000
deaths a year are attributed to complications caused by
bedsores. Bedsores can be slow to heal. Without proper
treatment, they can lead to:
• gangrene (tissue death)
• osteomyelitis (infection of the bone beneath the bed-
sore)
• sepsis (tissue-destroying bacterial infection)

Behcet’s syndrome
Definition
A group of symptoms that affect a variety of body sys-
tems, including musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and the
central nervous system. These symptoms include ulceration
of the mouth or the genital area,skin lesions, and inflam-
mation of the uvea (an area around the pupil of the eye).
Description
Behcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that involves
multiple body systems. The disease is named for a Turk-
ish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first reported a	patient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers along	with uveitisin 1937. The disease occurs worldwide, but
is most prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and in the
Mediterranean region. There is a wider prevalence
among males than females in a ratio of two to one.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown. Symp-
toms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genital
area, skin lesions, arthritis that affects mainly the knees
and ankles,painand irritation in the eyes, and fever. The
mouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples and
can be quite painful. In the mouth, these ulcers are gener-
ally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lips
or jaws. In the genital area, the ulcers usually occur on
the penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva of
women. The eye inflammation can lead to blindness.
Diagnosis
Because Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease,
it is difficult to diagnose. International criteria have been
proposed to assist in classifying this disease. There is no
one diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis depends
on grouping together enough symptoms in order to identify
the disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur in
other diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the other
diseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached.
Treatment
Some of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s syn-
drome include:
• corticosteroids
• cyclosporin
• azathioprine
• chlorambucil
• interferon alpha
• thalidomide
• levamisole
• pulse cyclophosphamide
• cyclosporine
Prognosis
The prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally
poor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s last-
ing for 17 years. Although the disease is considered
painful but not fatal, when the central nervous system is
involved there is usually severe disability and death
often occurs. The condition is usually chronic, although
there can be remissions during the course of the disease.

patients will progress into the more serious symptoms,
and which might move into remission.

There is no known prevention for Behcet’s syndrome.

regions. Unlike the better-known venereal syphilis,
endemic syphilis is not a sexually transmitted disease.	Description
Bejel has many other names depending on the locali-
ty: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo are
some of the names. It is most commonly found in the
Middle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa, central
Asia, and Australia. Bejel is related to yawsand pinta,
but has different symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes bejel,
is very closely related to the one that causes the sexually
transmitted form of syphilis, but transmission is very dif-
ferent. In bejel, transmission is by direct contact, with
broken skin or contaminated hands, or indirectly by shar-
ing drinking vessels and eating utensils. T. pallidumis
passed on mostly between children living in poverty in
very unsanitary environments and with poor hygiene.
The skin, bones, and mucous membranes are affect-
ed by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are common in
the mouth, throat, and nasal passages. Gummy lesions
may form, even breaking through the palate. Other find-
ings may include a region of swollen lymph nodes and
deep bone painin the legs. Eventually, bones may
become deformed.
Diagnosis
T. pallidumcan be detected by microscopic study of
samples taken from the sores or lymph fluid. However,
since antibody tests don’t distinguish between the types of
syphilis, specific diagnosis of the type of syphilis depends
on the patient’s history, symptoms, and environment.
Treatment
Large doses of benzathine penicillin G given by injec-
tion into the muscle can cure this disease in any stage,
although it may take longer and require additional doses in
later stages. If penicillin cannot be given, the alternative is
tetracycline. Since tetracycline can permanently discolor
new teeth still forming, it is usually not prescribed for chil-
dren unless no viable alternative is available.
Prognosis
Bejel is completely curable with antibiotic treatment.
Prevention
The World Health Organization (WHO) has worked
with many countries to prevent this and other diseases, and

spread use of penicillin has been responsible for reducing
the number of existing cases, but the only way to eliminate
bejel is by improving living and sanitation conditions.

Bell’s palsy
Definition
Bell’s palsy describes an unexplained weakness or
paralysisof the muscles on one side of the face. Afflict-
ed individuals may be unable to close the eye on the
affected side of the face, and may also experience tear-
ing, drooling, and hypersensitive hearing. The onset can
be quite sudden, sometimes occurring overnight.
Although Bell’s palsy is unsettling and inconvenient, it is
typically not indicative of a serious health problem. The
weakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majori-
ty of cases.
Description
Bell’s palsy has been described as a diagnosis of
exclusion because several other disorders present similar

symptoms. Facial palsies have been linked to conditions
such as Lyme disease, ear infection,meningitis,
syphilis, German measles(rubella),mumps,chicken-
pox(varicella), and infection with Epstein-Barr virus
(e.g.,infectious mononucleosis). True Bell’s palsy is an
idiopathic facial palsy, meaning the root cause cannot be
identified. Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it
can present symptoms similar to truly serious conditions,
such as a stroke, ruptured aneurysm, or tumors.
Every year, approximately 40,000-65,000 Americans
are stricken with Bell’s palsy. Worldwide, there is an
annual incidence of 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals.
An individual can be affected at any age, but young and
middle-aged adults are the most likely to be affected. It is
unusual to see Bell’s palsy in people less than 10 years
old. Bell’s palsy can affect either side of the face, and nei-
ther gender seems to be at a greater risk. Pregnant women
and individuals with diabetes,influenza, a cold, or an
upper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater risk.
Although it cannot be considered a serious condition from
a health standpoint, it can cause extreme stress, embar-
rassment, and inconvenience for those affected.
In the large majority of cases (80-85%), the facial
weakness or paralysis is temporary. However, individuals
who experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorer
recovery rate with only 60% returning to normal. Approx-
imately 4-6% of all Bell’s palsy cases result in permanent
facial deformity, and another 10-15% experience perma-
nent problems with spasms, twitching, or contracted mus-
cles. Between 2% and 7.3% of individuals who have
experienced Bell’s palsy will have a recurrence. On aver-
age, the first recurrence happens 9.8 years after the first
episode; the second, 6.7 years later. One recurrence is
very infrequent, and a second is extremely rare.
Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of Bell’s palsy arise from an inflam-
mation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve, other-
wise called the facial nerve. Both sides of the face have a
facial nerve which controls the muscles on that side of
the face. The course of the facial nerve passes through a
bony canal in the skull. When the nerve becomes
swollen, it is compressed since the canal does not allow
for any expansion. As further swelling increases the com-
pression, nerve signal conduction is impeded or even
prevented. The interference with the nerve signals is seen
in the loss of muscle control and tone.
Why the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bell’s
palsy is a matter of some debate, and medical researchers
and doctors are not in complete agreement. The best-sup-
ported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virus
(HSV), which is responsible for cold sores and fever
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	461
Bell’s palsy
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 461  blisters. HSV infection has been discovered in up to 70%
of Bell’s palsy cases. Most people harbor this virus,
although they may not exhibit symptoms.
The major symptom of Bell’s palsy is one-sided
facial weakness or paralysis. Muscle control is either
inadequate or completely missing. There may also be
involuntary facial movements, such as twitches, that
accompany certain facial expressions. Afflicted individu-
als frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eye
and may not be able to close it at all.
Diagnosis
Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it
shares symptoms in common with serious conditions,
such as stroke. Therefore, emergency medical attention is
a wise and necessary precaution. Bell’s palsy affects the
facial nerve, unlike most strokes associated with facial
weakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimately
supplying the facial nerve. These two disorders can be
distinquished clinically because most strokes do not
cause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles.
The fact that Bell’s palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion
becomes apparent in the course of the medical examina-
tion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out other
disorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders that
need to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g.,
multiple sclerosis), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viral
infection, and bone fracture.
During the physical examination, the afflicted indi-
vidual is asked about recent illnesses, accidents, infec-
tions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of the
ears, throat, and sinus is done, and hearing is tested. The
extent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym-
metry of the face at rest and during voluntary move-
ments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering the
lips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move-
ments are assessed in combination with the voluntary
movements. Neurologic examis done to rule out
involvement of other parts of the nervous system except
for the facial muscles, which would exclude the diagno-
sis of Bell’s palsy.
In response to the individual’s medical history,
blood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
analysisare ordered. The results of these tests help
determine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection or
an inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests, in
which a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated, may be
used to assess the condition of facial muscles and the
facial nerve. Common tests include electromyography,
which measures voluntary muscle movement, and nerve
conduction velocity, which determines the extent of
nerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also be
included, such as an x ray, as well as imaging tests, such
as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computed
tomography. These tests—especially MRI—allow an
excellent view of the nerve itself.
Once all other possibilities are exhausted, a diagno-
sis of Bell’s palsy is made. The following weeks are a
period of watchful waiting. Further examinations are
done to track recovery. Results from nerve conduction
tests may be used to predict an outcome. However, this
use is questioned by some doctors and medical
researchers since evidence for their predictive value is
inconclusive.
If facial movement, even a small amount, has not
returned within 3-4 months, the diagnosis of Bell’s palsy
may need to be reevaluated.
Treatment
Many doctors prescribe an antiviral and/or a steroid
for Bell’s palsy, but there is some controversy about
whether these drugs actually help. The consensus opin-
ion seems to be that, although drugs might not be neces-
sary, they are not dangerous, and they may help in some

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 462  cases, especially if there is complete paralysis. If drugs
are used, they need to be taken as soon as possible fol-
lowing the onset of symptoms. Antiviral drugs, such as
acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, are prescribed to
destroy actively replicating viruses and prevent further
damage to the facial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone,
are thought to be useful in reducing swelling and, there-
fore, compression on the nerve.
In the past, surgery was performed to relieve the
compression on the nerve. However, this treatment
option is now used very infrequently because it does not
guarantee recovery, and it carries the risk of permanent
nerve damage.
The need to protect the affected eye is universally
promoted. Since the individual may not be able to lower
the affected eyelid, the eye may become dry, particularly
at night. Excessive dryness can damage the cornea. Day-
time treatment includes artificial tears and may include
an eye patch or other protective measures. Nighttime
treatment involves a more intense effort at keeping the
eye protected. Eye lubricants or viscous ointments, along
with taping the eye shut, are frequently recommended.
In cases of permanent nerve damage, cosmetic treat-
ment options, such as therapeutic injections of botulism
toxin or surgery, may be sought or suggested.
Alternative treatment
Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicinehave
historically used acupunctureto treat Bell’s palsy. There
are also some indications that facial massage and chiro-
practicmanipulation may help treat the symptoms and
improve the outcome. There are also claims of therapeu-
tic value for local injections or ingestion of vitamin B
12
supplements.
Prognosis
Most individuals with Bell’s palsy begin to notice
improvement in their condition within 2-3 weeks of the
symptoms’ onset. At least 80% of them will be fully recov-
ered within three months. Among the other 20% of afflict-
ed individuals, symptoms may take longer to resolve or
they may be permanent. Individuals suffering permanent
nerve damage may not regain control of the muscles on
the affected side of the face. These muscles may remain
weak or paralyzed. If the nerve recovers imperfectly, they
may experience involuntary facial twitches or spasms that
accompany normal facial expressions.
Prevention
Bell’s palsy is not preventable.

Bence Jones protein test
Definition
Bence Jones proteins are small proteins (light chains
of immunoblobulin) found in the urine. Testing for these
proteins is done to diagnose and monitor multiple
myelomaand other similar diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	463
Bence Jones protein test
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 463  Purpose
Bence Jones proteins are considered the first tumor
marker. A tumor marker is a substance, made by the
body, that is linked to a certain cancer, or malignancy.
Bence Jones proteins are made by plasma cells, a type
of white blood cell. The presence of these proteins in a
person’s urine is associated with a malignancy of plas-
ma cells.
Multiple myeloma, a tumor of plasma cells, is the
disease most often linked with Bence Jones proteins. The
amount of Bence Jones proteins in the urine indicates
how much tumor is present. Physicians use Bence Jones
proteins testing to diagnose the disease as well as to
check how well the disease is responding to treatment.
Other diseases involving cancerous or excessive
growth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cells
can cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine. These
diseases include: Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia,
some lymphomas and leukemias, osteogenic sarcoma,
cryoglobulinemia, malignant B-cell disease,amyloi-
dosis, light chain disease, and cancer that has spread
to bone.
Description
Urine is the best specimen in which to look for
Bence Jones proteins. Proteins are usually too large to
move through a healthy kidney, from the blood into the
urine. Bence Jones proteins are an exception. They are
small enough to move quickly and easily through the
kidney into the urine.
A routine urinalysiswill not detect Bence Jones
proteins. There are several methods used by laboratories
to detect and measure these proteins. The classic Bence
Jones reaction involves heating urine to 140°F (60°C). At
this temperature, the Bence Jones proteins will clump.
The clumping disappears if the urine is further heated to
boiling and reappears when the urine is cooled. Other
clumping procedures using salts, acids, and other chemi-
cals are also used to detect these proteins. These types of

test will reveal whether or not Bence Jones proteins are
present, but not how much is present.
A more complex procedure is done to measure the
exact amount of Bence Jones proteins. This procedure—
immunoelectrophoresis—is usually done on urine that
has been collected for 24-hours.
The test is covered by insurance when medically nec-
essary. Results are usually available within several days.
Preparation
Urine is usually collected throughout a 24-hour time
period. A person is given a large container in which to
collect the urine. The urine should be refrigerated until it
is brought to the laboratory or physician’s office.
Normal results
Bence Jones proteins normally are not present in the
urine.
Abnormal results
Bence Jones proteins are present in 50–80% of peo-
ple with multiple myeloma. People with other malignan-
cies also can have a positive Bence Jones proteins test,
but less frequently.
Certain nonmalignant diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis,systemic lupus erythematosus, and chronic
renal insufficiency, can have Bence Jones proteins in the
urine. High doses of penicillin or aspirinbefore collect-
ing the urine can give a false positive result.

The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test (or Bender-
Gestalt test) is a psychological assessment used to evalu-

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 464  ate visual-motor functioning, visual-perceptual skills,
neurological impairment, and emotional disturbances in
children and adults ages three and older.
Purpose
The Bender-Gestalt is used to evaluate visual-
motor maturity and to screen children for developmen-
tal delays. The test is also used to assess brain damage
and neurological deficits. Individuals who have suf-
fered a traumatic brain injury may be given the Bender-
Gestalt as part of a battery of neuropsychological mea-
sures, or tests.
The Bender-Gestalt is sometimes used in conjunc-
tion with other personality tests to determine the pres-
ence of emotional and psychiatric disturbances such as
schizophrenia.
Precautions
Psychometric testing requires a clinically trained
examiner. The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test should
be administered and interpreted by a trained psychologist
or psychiatrist. The Bender-Gestalt should always be
employed as only one element of a complete battery of
psychological or developmental tests, and should never
be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.
Description
The original Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test was
developed in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender. There
are several different versions of the Bender-Gestalt avail-
able today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test; Modified Ver-
sion of the Bender-Gestalt test for Preschool and Primary
School Children; the Hutt Adaptation of the Bender-
Gestalt test; the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test for
Children; the Bender-Gestalt test for Young Children; the
Watkins Bender-Gestalt Scoring System; the Canter
Background Interference Procedure for the Bender-
Gestalt test). All use the same basic test materials, but
vary in their scoring and interpretation methods.
The standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test con-
sists of nine figures, each on its own 3 5 card. An
examiner presents each figure to the test subject one at a
time and asks the subject to copy it onto a single piece of
blank paper. The only instruction given to the subject is
that he or she should make the best reproduction of the
figure possible. The test is not timed, although standard
administration time is typically 10-20 minutes. After
testing is complete, the results are scored based on accu-
racy and organization. Interpretation depends on the
form of the test in use. Common features considered in
evaluating the drawings are rotation, distortion, symme-

The Bender-Gestalt can also be administered in a
group setting. In group testing, the figures are shown to
test subjects with a slide projector, in a test booklet, or on
larger versions of the individual test cards. Both the indi-
vidual and group- administered Bender-Gestalt evaluation
may take place in either an outpatient or hospital setting.
Patients should check with their insurance plans to deter-
mine if these or other mental health services are covered.
Normal results
Children normally improve in this test as they age,
but, because of the complexity of the scoring process,
results for the Bender-Gestalt should only be interpreted
by a clinically trained psychologist or psychiatrist.

Benzodiazepines
Definition
Benzodiazepines are medicines that help relieve ner-
vousness, tension, and other symptoms by slowing the
central nervous system.
Purpose
Benzodiazepines are a type of antianxiety drugs.
While anxietyis a normal response to stressful situa-
tions, some people have unusually high levels of anxiety
that can interfere with everyday life. For these people,
benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under con-
trol. The medicine can also relieve troubling symptoms
of anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat, breathing prob-
lems, irritability, nausea, and faintness.
Physicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for
other conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy and
other seizure disorders,phobias,panic disorder, with-
drawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,
this medicine should not be used every day for sleep
problems that last more than a few days. If used this way,
the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.
Benzodiazepines should not be used to relieve the
nervousness and tension of normal everyday life.
Description
The family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi-
azepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide
(Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).
These medicines take effect fairly quickly, starting to work
within an hour after they are taken. Benzodiazepines are
available only with a physician’s prescription and are	available in tablet, capsule, liquid, or injectable forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
benzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for which
it is being taken. Doses may be different for different
people. Check with the physician who prescribed the
drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the
correct dosage.
Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take
the drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does not
seem to be working, check with the physician who pre-
scribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop taking the
medicine unless the physician says to do so.Stopping the
drug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, espe-
cially if it has been taken in large doses or over a long
period. People who are taking the medicine for seizure
disorders may have seizures if they stop taking it sudden-
ly. If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine, check
with a physician for directions on how to stop. The physi-
cian may recommend tapering down gradually to reduce
the chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi-
azepines is important, especially during the first few
months of treatment. The physician will check to make
sure the medicine is working as it should and will note
unwanted side effects.
People who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous-
ness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder should
check with their physicians every two to three months to
make sure they still need to keep taking the medicine.
Patients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep
problems should check with their physicians if they are
not sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems that
last longer than this may be a sign of another medical
problem.
People who take this medicine to help them sleep
may have trouble sleeping when they stop taking the
medicine. This effect should last only a few nights.
Some people, especially older people, feel drowsy,
dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using benzodi-
azepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness or
unsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at bedtime,
these effects may even occur the next morning. Anyone
who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or
do anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the drugs affect them.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2466
Benzodiazepines
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 466  Benzodiazepines may also cause behavior changes
in some people, similar to those seen in people who act
differently when they drink alcohol. More extreme
changes, such as confusion, agitation, and hallucina-
tions, also are possible. Anyone who starts having
strange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking this
medicine should get in touch with his or her physician.
Because benzodiazepines work on the central ner-
vous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system,
such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,
sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain
relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may also add to the
effects of anesthetics, including those used for dental pro-
cedures. These effects may last several days after treat-
ment with benzodiazepines ends. The combined effects of
benzodiazepines and alcohol or other CNS depressants
(drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be very
dangerous, leading to unconsciousness or, rarely, even
death.Anyone taking benzodiazepines should not drink
alcohol and should check with his or her physician before
using any CNS depressants. Taking an overdose of benzo-
diazepines can also cause unconsciousness and possibly
death. Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or of the
effects of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol or
other drugs should get immediate emergency help.Warn-
ing signs include slurred speech or confusion, severe
drowsiness, staggering, and profound weakness.
Some benzodiazepines may change the results of
certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, any-
one taking this medicine should alert the health care pro-
fessional in charge.
Children are generally more sensitive than adults to
the effects of benzodiazepines. This sensitivity may
increase the chance of side effects.
Older people are more sensitive than younger adults
to the effects of this medicine and may be at greater risk
for side effects. Older people who take these drugs to
help them sleep may be drowsy during the day. Older
people also increase their risk of falling and injuring
themselves when they take these drugs.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take benzodiazepines. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions to
benzodiazepines or other mood-altering drugs in the past
should let his or her physician know before taking the
drugs again. The physician should also be told about any
allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY.Some benzodiazepines increase the
likelihood of birth defects. Using these medicines during
pregnancymay also cause the baby to become dependent
on them and to have withdrawal symptoms after birth.
When taken late in pregnancy or around the time of labor
and delivery, these drugs can cause other problems in the
newborn baby, such as weakness, breathing problems,
slow heartbeat, and body temperature problems.
Women who are pregnant or who may become preg-
nant should not use benzodiazepines unless their anxiety
is so severe that it threatens their pregnancy.Any woman
who must take this medicine while pregnant should be
sure to thoroughly discuss its risks and benefits with her
physician.
BREASTFEEDING.Benzodiazepines may pass into
breast milk and cause problems in babies whose mothers
taken the medicine. These problems include drowsiness,
breathing problems, and slow heartbeat. Women who are
breastfeeding their babies should not use this medicine
without checking with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ben-
zodiazepines, people with any of these medical problems
should make sure their physicians are aware of their con-
ditions:
• current or past drug or alcohol abuse
• depression
• severe mental illness
• epilepsy or other seizure disorders
• swallowing problems
• chronic lung disease such as emphysema,asthma,or
chronic bronchitis
• kidney disease
• liver disease
• brain disease
•glaucoma
• hyperactivity
• myasthenia gravis
• porphyria
• sleep apnea
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking benzodiaze-
pines with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, light-
headedness, drowsiness, clumsiness, unsteadiness, and

body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treat-
ment unless they persist or they interfere with normal
activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but may
occur. If any of the following side effects occur, check
with the physician who prescribed the medicine as soon
as possible:

Beriberi
Definition
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thi-
amine (vitamin B
1) that affects many systems of the
body, including the muscles, heart, nerves, and digestive
system. Beriberi literally means “I can’t, I can’t” in Sing-
halese, which reflects the crippling effect it has on its
victims. It is common in parts of southeast Asia, where
white rice is the main food. In the United States, beriberi
is primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism.
Description
Beriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav-
aged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it was
caused by something in food. Not until the early 1900s	did scientists discover that rice bran, the outer covering	that was removed to create the polished white rice pre-	ferred by Asians, actually contained something that pre-	vented the disease. Thiamine was the first vitamin identi-	fied. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were used	to treat the disease.
In adults, there are different forms of beriberi, classi-
fied according to the body systems most affected. Dry
beriberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi affects
the heart and circulation. Both types usually occur in the
same patient, with one set of symptoms predominating.
A less common form of cardiovascular, or wet
beriberi, is known as “shoshin.” This condition involves a
rapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure. It
is highly fatal and is known to cause sudden deathin
young migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists of
white rice.
Cerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affects
the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It can
be caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiamine
deficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting.
Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi-
amine-deficient mothers, who live in developing nations.
Although severe beriberi is uncommon in the United
States, less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur. About
25% of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the United
States show some evidence of thiamine deficiency.
Causes and symptoms
Thiamine is one of the B vitaminsand plays an
important role in energy metabolism and tissue building.
It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi-
amine pyrophosphate (TPP),which is essential in reac-
tions that produce energy from glucose or that convert
glucose to fat for storage in the tissues. When there is not
enough thiamine in the diet, these basic energy functions
are disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body.
Special situations, such as an over-active metabo-
lism, prolonged fever,pregnancy, and breastfeeding,
can increase the body’s thiamine requirements and lead
to symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diar-
rheaor chronic liver disease can result in the body’s
inability to maintain normal levels of many nutrients,
including thiamine. Other persons at risk are patients
with kidney failure on dialysis and those with severe
digestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrients.
Alcoholics are susceptible because they may substitute
alcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcohol
decreases the body’s ability to absorb thiamine.

Beriberi
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 469  The following systems are most affected by beriberi:
• Gastrointestinal system. When the cells of the smooth
muscles in the digestive system and glands do not get
enough energy from glucose, they are unable to pro-
duce more glucose from the normal digestion of food.
There is a loss of appetite,indigestion, severe consti-
pation, and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
• Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central
nervous system to function normally. Early deficiency
symptoms are fatigue, irritability, and poor memory. If
the deficiency continues, there is damage to the periph-
eral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscle
weakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The
legs are most affected. The toes feel numb and the feet
have a burning sensation; the leg muscles become sore
and the calf muscles cramp. The individual walks
unsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squatting
position. Eventually, the muscles shrink (atrophy) and
there is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet; the feet
may hang limp (footdrop).
• Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat and
sweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.
Because the smooth muscle in the blood vessels is
affected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling,
known as edema, in the legs.
• Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread muscle
paincaused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue.
Infants who are breastfed by a thiamine-deficient mother
usually develop symptoms of deficiency between the
second and fourth month of life. They are pale, restless,
unable to sleep, prone to diarrhea, and have muscle
wasting and edema in their arms and legs. They have a
characteristic, sometimes silent, cry and develop heart
failure and nerve damage.
Diagnosis
A physical examinationwill reveal many of the
early symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation,
nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but the deficien-
cy may be difficult to identify. Information about the
individual’s diet and general health is also needed.
There are many biochemical tests based on thiamine
metabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thi-
amine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can be measured in
the blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a defi-
ciency. The urine can be collected for 24 hours to mea-
sure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable test
measures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activity
since all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of red
blood cells.
An electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures
electrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule out
other causes of neurologic changes. Observing improve-
ments in the patient after giving thiamine supplements
will also confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in
the body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe thi-
amine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiamine
given by injection into a muscle (intramuscular) or in a
solution that goes into a vein (intravenously) for several
days. Then smaller doses can be given either by injection
or in pill form until the patient recovers. Usually there
are other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will also
need treatment.
The cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can
respond to treatment within a few hours if they are not
too severe. Heart failure may require additional treatment
with diureticsthat help eliminate excess fluid and with
heart-strengthening drugs like digitalis.
Recovery from peripheral neuropathy and other
symptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patients
frequently become discouraged. They should stay active;
physical therapy will also help in recovery.
Infantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to
both the infant and the breast feeding mother until levels
are normal.
In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine should
be given intravenously or by injection at first because the
intestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impaired
and the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will be
relieved by treatment, though there may be residual
memory loss.
Excess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine,
and negative reactions to too much thiamine are rare.
Thiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it should not
be taken with antacidsor barbiturates.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for beriberi deal first with
correcting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventional
treatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stressa
diet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vita-
mins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw fruits and
vegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt. Drinking
more than one glass of liquid with a meal should be
avoided, since this may wash out the vitamins before
they can be absorbed by the body. Thiamine should be
taken daily, with the dose depending on the severity of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2470
Beriberi
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 470  the disease. Additional supplements of B vitamins, a
multivitamin and mineral complex, and Vitamin C are
also recommended. Other alternative therapies may help
relieve the person’s symptoms after the thiamine defi-
ciency is corrected.
Prognosis
Beriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the defi-
ciency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most of the
symptoms can be reversed and full recovery is possible
when thiamine levels are returned to normal and main-
tained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements as
needed.
Prevention
A balanced diet containing all essential nutrients
will prevent a thiamine deficiency and the development
of beriberi. People who consume large quantities of junk
food like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high carbohy-
drate foods made with unenriched flours may be defi-
cient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They may
need to take vitamin supplements and should improve
their diets.
Dietary Requirements
The body’s requirements for thiamine are tied to car-
bohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms of total
intake of calories. The current recommended dietary
allowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for every 1,000 calories,
with a minimum daily intake of 1 mg even for those who
eat fewer than 2,000 calories in a day. The RDA for chil-
dren and teenagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg daily
for males over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females. Dur-
ing pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is needed.
Because of increased energy needs and the secretion of
thiamine in breast milk, breast feeding mothers need 1.5
mg every day. In infants, 0.4 mg is advised.
Food Sources
The best food sources of thiamine are lean pork,
beef, liver, brewer’s yeast, peas and beans, whole or
enriched grains, and breads. The more refined the food,
as in white rice, white breads, and some cereals, the
lower the thiamine. Many food products are enriched
with thiamine, along with riboflavin, niacin, and iron, to
prevent dietary deficiency.
During the milling process, rice is polished and all the
vitamins in the exterior coating of bran are lost. Boiling the
rice before husking preserves the vitamins by distributing
them throughout the kernel. Food enrichment programs
have eliminated beriberi in Japan and the Phillipines
KEY TERMS
B vitamins—This family of vitamins consists of thi-
amine (B
1), riboflavin (B
2), niacin (B
3), pantothenic
acid (B
5), pyridoxine (B
6), biotin, folic acid (B
9),
and cobalamin (B
12). They are interdependent and
involved in converting glucose to energy.
Coenzyme—A substance needed by enzymes to
produce many of the reactions in energy and pro-
tein metabolism in the body.
Edema—An excess accumulation of fluid in the
cells and tissues.
Enzyme—A protein that acts as a catalyst to pro-
duce chemical changes in other substances with-
out being changed themselves.
Metabolism—All the physical and chemical
changes that take place within an organism.
Peripheral neuropathy—A disease affecting the
portion of the nervous system outside the brain
and spinal chord. One or more nerves can be
involved, causing sensory loss, muscle weakness
and shrinkage, and decreased reflexes.
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)—The coenzyme
containing thiamine that is essential in converting
glucose to energy.
Like all B vitamins, thiamine is water soluble, which
means it is easily dissolved in water. It will leach out dur-
ing cooking in water and is destroyed by high heat and
overcooking.

Beriberi
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 471  Berylliosis
Definition
Berylliosis is lung inflammation caused by inhaling
dust or fumes that contain the metallic element beryllium.
Found in rocks, coal, soil, and volcanic dust, beryllium is
used in the aerospace industry and in many types of man-
ufacturing. Berylliosis occurs in both acute and chronic
forms. In some cases, appearance of the disease may be
delayed as much as 20 years after exposure to beryllium.
Description
In the 1930s, scientists discovered that beryllium
could make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During the
following decade, the hard, grayish metal was identified
as the cause of a potentially debilitating, sometimes
deadly disease characterized by shortness of breathand
inflammation, swelling, and scarring of the lungs.
The manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no
longer a source of beryllium exposure, but serious health
hazards are associated with any work environment or
process in which beryllium fumes or particles become
airborne. Working with pure beryllium, beryllium com-
pounds (e.g. beryllium oxide), or beryllium alloys causes
occupational exposure. So do jobs involving:
• electronics
• fiber optics
• manufacturing ceramics, bicycle frames, golf clubs,
mirrors, and microwave ovens
• mining
• nuclear weapons and reactors
• reclaiming scrap metal
• space and atomic engineering.
• dental and laboratory technology
Beryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic air
pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). It is estimated that 2–6% of workers exposed to
these contaminants eventually develop berylliosis.
Causes and symptoms
Coughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss that
begin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. This
condition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflames
the lungs making them rigid; it can affect the eyes and skin
as well. People who have acute berylliosis are usually very
ill. Most recover, but some die of the disease.
Chronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to long-
term exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust or
fumes. A systemic disease that causes formation of
abnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymph	nodes, chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts of	the body. The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are large-	ly the same as those seen in acute berylliosis, but they	develop more slowly.
Diagnosis
Berylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp-
toms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure. A
chest x rayshows characteristic changes in the lungs.
However, since these changes can resemble those caused
by other lung diseases, further testing may be necessary.
The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT),
a blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. an
allergic reaction to beryllium), is used to screen individuals
at risk of developing berylliosis. When screening results
reveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed on
cells washed from the lungs. This test is now considered
the most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis.
Treatment
Individuals with beryllium sensitivity or early-stage
berylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involve
beryllium exposure and regularly examined to determine
whether the disease has progressed.
Acute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion-
ally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with acute
berylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy is
required to lessen lung inflammation.
Chronic beryllium disease is incurable. Corticos-
teroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is not certain that
steroids can alter the progression of the disease, and they
have no effect on scarring of lung tissue. Cleansing the
lungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term thera-
py may be required. Chelation therapyis currently
under investigation as a treatment for the disease.
Prognosis
Most patients with acute berylliosis recover fully
7–10 days after treatment begins, and the disease usually
causes no after effects.
Patients whose lungs are severely damaged by
chronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure
because of the strain placed on the heart.
Prevention
Eliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way
to prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who are
exposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop an
allergic reaction to these substances is an effective way
to control symptoms and prevent disease progression.

ating a person for certain kinds of canceraffecting white
blood cells including chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and multiple myelomaor
kidney disease.
Purpose
Beta
2-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface of
white blood cells. Increased production or destruction of
these cells causes Beta
2-microglobulin levels in the blood
to increase. This increase is seen in people with cancers
involving white blood cells, but it is particularly mean-
ingful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myelo-
ma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy (cancer) of a cer-
tain kind of white blood cell, called a plasma cell. At the
time of diagnosis, the Beta
2-microglobulin levels reflect
how advanced the disease is and the likely prognosis for
that person.
When kidney disease is suspected, comparing blood
and urine levels helps identify where the kidney is dam-
aged. Beta
2-microglobulin normally is filtered out of the
blood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round mass of capil-
lary loops leading to each kidney tubule), only to be par-
tially reabsorbed back into the blood when it reaches the
kidney’s tubules. In glomerular kidney disease, the
glomeruli can’t filter it out of the blood, so levels
increase in the blood and decrease in the urine. In tubular
kidney disease, the tubules can’t reabsorb it back into the
blood, so urine levels rise and blood levels fall. After a
kidney transplant, increased blood levels may be an early
sign of rejection.
Increased urinary levels are found in people with
kidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavy
metals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of work-
ers exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kid-
ney damage.
Beta
2-microglobulin levels also rise during infec-
tion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus and
human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV). Studies show
that as HIV disease advances, beta
2-microglobulin lev-
els rise.
Description
Testing methods vary, but most involve adding the
person’s serum—the yellow, liquid part of blood—or
urine to one or more substances that bind to beta
2-
microglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of the
substance(s) bound to beta
2-microglobulin is measured
and the original amount of beta
2-microglobulin is
determined.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 473  Preparation
The blood test requires 5 mL of blood. A healthcare
worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper arm,
locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a
needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood
through the needle into an attached tube. Collection of
the sample takes only a few minutes.
Urine may be a single collection or collected
throughout a 24-hour time period. The urine should be
refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory and must
not become acidic.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the
puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.
Warm packs on the puncture site relieve discomfort.
Normal results
• Serum: less than or equal to 2.7 g/mL
• Urine: less than 1 mg/24 hours or 0-160 g/L

Beta blockers
Definition
Beta blockers are medicines that affect the body’s
response to certain nerve impulses. This, in turn, decreases
the force and rate of the heart’s contractions, which lowers
blood pressure and reduces the heart’s demand for oxygen.
Purpose
The main use of beta blockers is to treat high blood
pressure. Some also are used to relieve the type of chest
paincalled anginaor to prevent heart attacks in people
who already have had one heart attack. These drugs
may also be prescribed for other conditions, such as
migraine,tremors, and irregular heartbeat. In eye drop
form, they are used to treat certain kinds of glaucoma.
Description
Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic block-
ers, are available only with a physician’s prescription.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2474
Beta blockers
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 474  The come in capsule, tablet, liquid, and injectable forms.
Some common beta blockers are atenolol (Tenormin),
metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), propranolol
(Inderal), and timolol (Blocadren). Timolol and certain
other beta blockers are also sold in eye drop form for
treating glaucoma. Eye drops that contain beta blockers
include betaxolol (Betoptic), cartelol (Ocupress), and
timolol (Timoptic).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type,
strength, and form of beta blocker and the condition for
which it is prescribed. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-
scription for the correct dosage.
This medicine may take several weeks to noticeably
lower blood pressure. Taking it exactly as directed is
important.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it. Some conditions
may get worse when patients stop taking beta blockers
abruptly. This may also increase the risk of heart attack
in some people. Because of these possible effects, it is
important to keep enough medicine on hand to get
through weekends, holidays, and vacations.
Physicians may recommend that patients check their
pulse before and after taking this medicine. If the pulse
becomes too slow, circulation problems may result.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking beta
blockers is important. The physician will check to make
sure the medicine is working as it should and will watch
for unwanted side effects. People who have high blood
pressure often feel perfectly fine. However, they should
continue to see their physicians even when they feel well
so that the physician can keep a close watch on their con-
dition. Patients also need to keep taking their medicine
even when they feel fine.
Beta blockers will not cure high blood pressure, but
will help control the condition. To avoid the serious
health problems that high blood pressure can cause,
patients may have to take medicine for the rest of their
lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.
Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoid
certain foods and keep their weight under control. The
health care professional who is treating the condition can
offer advice on what measures may be necessary.
Patients being treated for high blood pressure should not
change their dietswithout consulting their physicians.
Anyone taking beta blockers for high blood pressure
should not take any other prescription or over-the-
counter medicine without first checking with his or her
physician. Some medicines may increase blood pressure.
Anyone who is taking beta blockers should be sure
to tell the health care professional in charge before hav-
ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-
gency treatment.
Some beta blockers may change the results of cer-
tain medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone
taking this medicine should alert the health care profes-
sional in charge.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded
when taking beta blockers. Anyone who takes these
drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else
that might be dangerous until they have found out how
the drugs affect them.
Beta blockers may increase sensitivity to cold, espe-
cially in older people or people who have poor circula-
tion. Anyone who takes this medicine should dress
warmly in cold weather and should be careful not to be
exposed to the cold for too long.
People who usually have chest pain when they exer-
ciseor exert themselves may not have the pain when they
are taking beta blockers. This could lead them to be more
active than they should be. Anyone taking this medicine
should ask his or her physician how much exercise and
activity is safe.
Older people may be unusually sensitive to the
effects of beta blockers. This may increase the chance of
side effects.
Physicians may advise people taking beta blockers
to wear or carry medical identification indicating that
they are taking this medicine.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medicines may have problems if
they take beta blockers. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to beta blockers in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergiesto insect stings,
medicines, foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-
stances. In people with allergies to medicines, foods, or
insect stings, beta blockers may make the allergic reac-
tions more severe and harder to treat. Anyone who has an
allergic reaction while taking beta blockers should get
medical attention right away and should make sure the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	475
Beta blockers
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 475  physician in charge knows that he or she is taking this
medicine.
Beta blockers may also cause serious reactions in
people who take allergy shots. Anyone taking this medi-
cine should be sure to alert the physician before having
any allergy shots.
DIABETES.Beta blockers may make blood sugar lev-
els rise and may hide some symptoms of low blood
sugar. Diabetic patients should discuss these possible
problems with their physicians.
PREGNANCY.Some studies of beta blockers show
that these drugs cause problems in newborns whose
mothers use them during pregnancy. Other studies do
not show such effects. Women who are pregnant or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
about the use of beta blockers.
BREASTFEEDING.Some beta blockers pass into
breast milk and may cause breathing problems, slow
heartbeat, and low blood pressure in nursing babies
whose mothers take the drugs. Women who need to take
beta blockers and who want to breastfeed their babies
should check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Beta blockers may
increase breathing problems or make allergic reactions
more severe in people who have allergies,bronchitis,or
emphysema.
In people with an overactive thyroid, stopping beta
blockers suddenly may cause an increase in symptoms.
Also, taking this medicine may hide a fast heartbeat,
which is one of the symptoms of overactive thyroid.
Effects of these drugs may be greater in people with
kidney or liver disease because the medicine is cleared
from the body more slowly.
Beta blockers may also make the following medical
conditions worse:
• Heart or blood vessel disease
• Unusually slow heartbeat (bradycardia)
• Myasthenia gravis (chronic disease causing muscle
weakness and possibly paralysis)
• Psoriasis (itchy, scaly, red patches of skin)
• Depression (now, or in the past).
Before using beta blockers, people with any of the
medical problems listed in this section should make sure
their physicians are aware of their conditions.
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.Taking beta blockers
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness,
drowsiness, lightheadedness, sleep problems, unusual
tiredness or weakness, and decreased sexual ability. In
men, this can occur as impotenceor delayed ejaculation.
These problems usually go away as the body adjusts to
the drug and do not require medical treatment unless they
persist or they interfere with normal activities.
More serious side effects are possible. If any of the
following side effects occur, check with the physician
who prescribed the medicine as soon as possible:
• Breathing problems
• Slow heartbeat
• Cold hands and feet
• Swollen ankles, feet, or lower legs.
• Mental depression.
Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking beta blockers should get
in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Beta blockers may interact with a number of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes beta blockers should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with beta blockers are:

Bile duct cancer
Definition
Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, is a malig-
nant tumor of the bile ducts within the liver (intrahepatic),
or leading from the liver to the small intestine (extrahepat-
ic). It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients.
Description
Bile is a substance manufactured by the liver that
aids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels that
carry the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Like
the tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in the liver
converge into two large bile ducts called the left and right
hepatic ducts. These exit the liver and join to form the
common hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concen-
trates and stores the bile, empties into the common
hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Finally, this
large duct connects to the small intestine where the bile
can help digest food. Collectively, this network of bile
ducts is called the biliary tract.
Bile duct cancer originates from the cells that line
the inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may arise
anywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outside
of the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-growing
tumors that spread by local invasion of neighboring
structures and by way of lymphatic channels.
Bile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In the
United States, approximately one case arises per 100,000
people per year, but it is more common in Southeast
Asia. It occurs in men only slightly more often than in
women, and it is most commonly diagnosed in people in
their 50s and 60s.
Causes and symptoms
A number of risk factors are associated with the
development of bile duct cancer:
• Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This disease is charac-
terized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract, some-
times associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
• Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations of
the biliary tract that usually form during fetal develop-
ment. There is evidence that these cysts may rarely
arise during adulthood.
• Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone formation
within the liver (not including gallbladder stones).
• Liver flukes. Parasitic infection with certain worms is
thought to be at least partially responsible for the higher
prevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast Asia.

injected intravenously during certain types of x rays. It
is not in use anymore. Exposure to Thorotrast has been
implicated in the development of cancer of the liver as
well as the bile ducts.
Symptoms
Jaundiceis the first symptom in 90% of patients.
This occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an obstruc-
tion in the normal flow of bile from the liver to the small
intestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile, builds up within
the liver and is absorbed into the bloodstream in excess
amounts. This can be detected in a blood test, but it can
also manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin and
eyes. The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes the
urine appear dark. Additionally, the patient may experi-
ence generalized itchingdue to the deposition of bile
components in the skin. Normally, a portion of the bile is
excreted in stool; bile actually gives stool its brown
color. But when the biliary tract is obstructed by tumor,
the stools may appear pale.
Abdominal pain,fatigue, weight loss, and poor
appetite are less common symptoms. Occasionally, if
obstruction of the biliary tract causes the gallbladder to

swell enormously yet without causing pain, the physician
may be able to feel the gallbladder during a physical
examination. Sometimes the biliary tract can become
infected, but this is normally a rare consequence of inva-
sive tests. Infection causes fever, chills, and pain in the
right upper portion of the abdomen.
Diagnosis
Certain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in the
diagnosis. The most important one is the test for elevated
bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of alkaline
phosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be elevated.
When symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests
poinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, then
the next step involves radiographic tests. Ultrasound and
computed tomography (CT scan) are noninvasive and
rapid. These tests can often detect the actual tumor as
well as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract. If these
tests indicate the presence of a tumor, then cholangiogra-
phy is required. This procedure involves injecting dye
into the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bile
ducts and the tumor. The specialist that performs this test
can also insert small tubes, or stents, into a partially
obstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent further
obstruction by growth of the tumor. This is vitally impor-
tant since it may be the only intervention that is possible
in certain patients. Cholangiography is an invasive test
that carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tract.
The objective of these radiological tests is to determine
the size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent of
spread to nearby structures.
The treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not
affected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprise
the tumor. For this reason, some physicians forego biop-
sy of the tumor.
Treatment
The treatment is with surgical resection (removal) of
the tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,
sometimes the cancer has already spread too far when the
diagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile duct can-
cer, the first question to answer is if the tumor may be
safely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to the
patient. If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or has
spread widely throughout the liver, then resection may not
be possible. Sometimes further invasive testing is required.
Angiographycan determine if the blood vessels are
involved. Laparoscopyis a surgical procedure that allows
the surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymph
nodes without making a large incision in the abdomen. Only
about 45% of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable.

Bile duct cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 478  If the tumor is resectable, and the patient is healthy
enough to tolerate the operation, then the specific type of
surgery performed depends on the location of the tumor.
For tumors within the liver or high up in the biliary tract,
resection of part of the liver may be required. Tumors in
the middle portion of the biliary tract can be removed
alone. Tumors of the lower end of the biliary tract may
require extensive resection of part of the pancreas, small
intestine, and stomach to ensure complete resection.
Unfortunately, sometimes the cancer appears
resectable by all the radiological and invasive tests, but is
found to be unresectable during surgery. In this scenario, a
bypass operation can relieve the biliary tract obstruction,
but does not remove the tumor itself. This does not produce
a cure but it can offer a better quality of life for the patient.
Chemotherapyand radiation therapyhave not
been proven effective in the treatment of bile duct cancer.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the stage and resectability of
the tumor. If the patient cannot undergo surgical resec-
tion, then the survival rate is commonly less than one
year. If the tumor is resected, the survival rate improves,
with 20% of these patients surviving past five years.
Clinical trials
Studies of new treatments in patients are known as
clinical trials. These trials seek to compare the standard
method of care with a new method, or the trials may be try-
ing to establish whether one treatment is more beneficial
for certain patients than others. Sometimes, a new treat-
ment that is not being offered on a wide scale may be avail-
able to patients participating in clinical trials, but participat-
ing in the trials may involve some risk. To learn more about
clinical trials, patients can call the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) at 1-800-4-CANCER or visit the NCI web site for
patients at <http://www.cancertrials.nci.nih.gov>.
Prevention
Other than the avoidance of infections caused by liver
flukes, there are no known preventions for this cancer.

Biliary atresia
Definition
Biliary atresia is the failure of a fetus to develop an
adequate pathway for bile to drain from the liver to the
intestine.
Description
Biliary atresia is the most common lethal liver disease
in children, occurring once every 10,000–15,000 live
births. Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason.
The normal anatomy of the bile system begins with-
in the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts collect
bile from liver cells. These ducts merge into larger and
larger channels, like streams flowing into rivers, until
they all pour into a single duct that empties into the duo-
denum (first part of the small intestine). Between the
liver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel con-
nected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores bile
and concentrates it, removing much of its water content.
Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the gall bladder
contracts and empties its contents.
Bile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver
removes from the circulation and excretes through the
biliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bile
assists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile cannot
get out because the channels are absent or blocked, it
backs up into the liver and eventually into the rest of the
body. The major pigment in bile is a chemical called
bilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a breakdown prod-
uct of hemoglobin (the red chemical in blood that carries
oxygen). If the body accumulates an excess of bilirubin,

Duodenum—The first part of the small intestine,
beginning at the outlet of the stomach.
Hemoglobin—The red, iron-containing chemical

Jaundice—The yellow color taken on by a patient

it turns yellow (jaundiced). Bile also turns the stool
brown. Without it, stools are the color of clay.
Causes and symptoms
It is possible that a viral infection is responsible for
this disease, but evidence is not yet convincing. The
cause remains unknown.
The affected infant will appear normal at birth and
during the newborn period. After two weeks the normal
jaundiceof the newborn will not disappear, and the
stools will probably be clay-colored. At this point, the
condition will come to the attention of a physician. If not,
the child’s abdomen will begin to swell, and the infant
will get progressively more ill. Nearly all untreated chil-
dren will die of liver failure within two years.
Diagnosis
The persistence of jaundice beyond the second week
in a newborn with clay-colored stools is a sure sign of
obstruction to the flow of bile. An immediate evaluation
that includes blood tests and imaging of the biliary sys-
tem will confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment. Somehow the surgeon
must create an adequate pathway for bile to escape the
liver into the intestine. The altered anatomy of the biliary
system is different in every case, calling upon the sur-
geon’s skill and experience to select and execute the most
effective among several options. If the obstruction is only
between the gall bladder and the intestine, it is possible to
attach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder. More
likely, the upper biliary system will also be inadequate,
and the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly to
the liver—the Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the body
will discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liver
are discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bile
will begin to flow in that direction, and the channels will
gradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai procedure
are commonly 50% at five years and 15% at 10 years. Per-
sistent disease in the liver gradually destroys the organ.
Liver transplantationmust be anticipated in all but
the few patients who continue to do well after a Kasai
procedure. Accumulating experience and newer tech-
niques of liver transplantation are producing very gratify-
ing early results.
Prognosis
Before liver transplants became available, even
prompt and effective surgery did not cure the whole
problem. Biliary drainage can usually be established, but
the patients still have a defective biliary system that
develops progressive disease and commonly leads to an
early death. Transplantation now achieves up to 90%
one-year survival rates and promises to prevent the
chronic disease that used to accompany earlier proce-
dures.
Prevention
The specific cause of this birth defect is unknown, so
all that women can do is to practice the many general
preventive measures, even before they conceive.

Binge-eating disorder
Definition
Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by a
loss of control over eating behaviors. The binge eater
consumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short
time period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularly
engage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors
(for example, excessive exercise, vomiting, taking laxa-
tives) following the binge episodes.
Description
BED typically strikes individuals sometime between
adolescence and the early twenties. Because of the nature
of the disorder, most BED patients are overweight or
obese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown that
an average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these pro-
grams report binge eating behavior.
Causes and symptoms
Binge eating episodes may act as a psychological
release for excessive emotional stress. Other circum-
stances that may predispose an individual to BED include
heredity and affective disorders, such as major depression.
BED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid, or
co-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam-
ple, compulsive buying),post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD),panic disorder, or personality disorders.
Individuals who develop BED often come from fam-
ilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance of
food, for example, as a source of comfort in times of
emotional distress. As children, BED patients may have
been taught to clean their plate regardless of their
appetite, or that finishing a meal made them a “good”
girl or boy. Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thin-
ness may also be a factor in the BED equation.
During binge episodes, BED patients experience a
definite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat
quickly and to the point of discomfort even if they aren’t
hungry. They typically binge alone two or more times a
week, and often feel depressed and guilty once the
episode has concluded.
Diagnosis
Binge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treated
by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to an
interview with the patient, personality and behavioral
inventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person-
ality Inventory(MMPI), may be administered as part of
the assessment process. One of several clinical inventories,
or scales, may also be used to assess depressive symptoms,
including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be
administered in an outpatient or hospital setting.
Treatment
Many BED individuals binge after long intervals of
excessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize this
pattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach the
patient to gain control over his eating behavior by focus-
ing on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog-
nitive-behavioral therapy,group therapy, or interper-
sonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover the
emotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioral
patterns behind the binge eating.
Because the prevalence of depression in BED
patients is high, psychopharmacological treatment with
antidepressants may also be prescribed. Once the binge
eating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms are
controlled, the physical symptoms of BED can be
addressed. The overweight BED patient may be placed
on a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may be
consulted to educate the patient on healthy food choices
and strategies for weight loss.
Prognosis
The poor dietary habits and obesitythat are sympto-
matic of BED can lead to serious health problems, such as
high blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left

Binge-eating disorder
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 481  unchecked. BED is a chronic condition that requires ongo-
ing medical and psychological management. To bring
long-term relief to the BED patient, it is critical to address
the underlying psychological causes behind binge eating
behaviors. It appears that up to 50% of BED patients will
stop bingeing with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

Biofeedback
Definition
Biofeedback, or applied psychophysiological feed-
back, is a patient-guided treatment that teaches an indi-
vidual to control muscle tension,pain, body temperature,
brain waves, and other bodily functions and processes
through relaxation, visualization, and other cognitive con-
trol techniques. The name biofeedback refers to the bio-
logical signals that are fed back, or returned, to the patient
in order for the patient to develop techniques of manipu-
lating them.
Purpose
Biofeedback has been used to successfully treat a
number of disorders and their symptoms, including tem-
poromandibular joint disorder(TMJ), chronic pain,
irritable bowel syndrome(IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome,
epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), migraine headaches,anxiety, depression, trau-
matic brain injury, and sleep disorders.
Illnesses that may be triggered at least in part by
stressare also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain
types of headaches, high blood pressure,bruxism(teeth
grinding),post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disor-
ders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disordersmay
be treated successfully by teaching patients the ability to
relax and release both muscle and mental tension.
Biofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive
treatment program for some of these disorders.
NASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat
astronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, during
which the autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scien-
tists at the University of Tennessee have adapted these
techniques to treat individuals suffering from severe
nausea and vomitingthat is also rooted in autonomic
nervous system dysfunction.
Recent research also indicates that biofeedback may
be a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti-
nenceregain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-
floor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better con-
trol over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors are
placed on the muscles to train the patient where they are
and when proper contractions are taking place.
Description
Origins
In 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist,
suggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2482
Biofeedback
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 482  instance, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal
activity, regional blood flow) could be under voluntary
control. As a result of his experiments, he showed that
such autonomic processes were controllable. This work
led to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work
was expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, research
performed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry
Sterman established that both cats and monkeys could be
trained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman then
used his research techniques on human patients with
epilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%
with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the
1970s, other researchers published reports of their use of
biofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias,
headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomach
acid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since the
early work of Miller and Sterman, biofeedback has
developed into a front-line behavioral treatment for an
even wider range of disorders and symptoms.
During biofeedback, special sensors are placed on
the body. These sensors measure the bodily function that
is causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heart
rate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec-
tromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-
troencophalographic feedback), respiration, and body
temperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor-
mation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as a
paper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.
While the patient views the instantaneous feedback
from the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog-
nize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence his
or her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationship
between mind and body, the patient can then use these
same thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as these
act as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-
ious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,
brain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily
functions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,
mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.
As the biofeedback response takes place, patients
can actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant-
ly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip-
ment. Once these techniques are learned and the patient
is able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualiza-
tion necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeedback
equipment itself is no longer needed. The patient then
has a powerful, portable, and self-administered treatment
tool to deal with problem symptoms.
Biofeedback that specializes in reading and altering
brain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback. The
brain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta,
theta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre-
quency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brain
wave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, which
occur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35
Hz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averages
fall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-
arousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be present
in conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-
order, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxiety
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive
stress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizing
that beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14
Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-
es on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) and
theta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated with
deep, meditative states, and has been used with some
success in substance abuse treatment.
Through brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback
can be useful in treating a variety of disorders that are
suspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, such
as epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraine
headaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,
and sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeed-
back usually uses a monitor as an output device. The
monitor displays specific patterns that the patient
attempts to change by producing the appropriate type of
brain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient for
producing the appropriate brain wave by producing a
positive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children may
be rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis-
played video game.

may need up to 30 sessions with a trained professional to

the patients medical history and treatment background
and discuss goals for therapy.

from the patient to determine his or her baseline brain-
wave pattern.
Biofeedback typically is performed in a quiet and
relaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for the
patient. Depending on the type and goals of biofeedback
being performed, one or more sensors will be attached to
the patient’s body with conductive gel and/or adhesives.
These may include:
• Electromyographic (EMG) sensors. EMG sen-
sors measure electrical activity in the muscles, specifical-
ly muscle tension. In treating TMJ or bruxism, these sen-
sors would be placed along the muscles of the jaw.
Chronic pain might be treated by monitoring electrical
energy in other muscle groups.
• Galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors. These are elec-
trodes placed on the fingers that monitor perspiration,
or sweat gland, activity. These may also be called skin
conductance level (SCL).
• Temperature sensors. Temperature, or thermal, sensors
measure body temperature and changes in blood flow.
• Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. These elec-
trodes are applied to the scalp to measure the electrical
activity of the brain, or brain waves.
• Heart rate sensors. A pulse monitor placed on the finger
tip can monitor pulse rate.
• Respiratory sensors. Respiratory sensors monitor oxy-
gen intake and carbon dioxide output.
Precautions
Individuals who use a pacemaker or other
implantable electrical devices should inform their
biofeedback therapist before starting treatments, as cer-
tain types of biofeedback sensors have the potential to
interfere with these devices.
Biofeedback may not be suitable for some patients.
Patients must be willing to take a very active role in the
treatment process. And because biofeedback focuses
strictly on behavioral change, those patients who wish to
gain insight into their symptoms by examining their past
might be better served by psychodynamic therapy.
Biofeedback may also be inappropriate for cogni-
tively impaired individuals, such as those patients with
organic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury, depend-
ing on their levels of functioning.
Patients with specific pain symptoms of unknown
origin should undergo a thorough medical examination
before starting biofeedback treatments to rule out any
serious underlying disease. Once a diagnosis has been
made, biofeedback can be used concurrently with con-
ventional treatment.
Biofeedback may only be one component of a com-
prehensive treatment plan. For illnesses and symptoms
that are manifested from an organic disease process, such
as canceror diabetes, biofeedback should be an adjunct
to (complementary to), and not a replacement for, con-
ventional medical treatment.
Side effects
There are no known side effects to properly adminis-
tered biofeedback or neurofeedback sessions.
Research and general acceptance
Preliminary research published in late 1999 indicat-
ed that neurofeedback may be a promising new tool in
the treatment of schizophrenia. Researchers reported
that schizophrenic patients had used neurofeedback to
simulate brain wave patterns that antipsychotic medica-
tions produce in the brain. Further research is needed to
determine what impact this may have on treatment for
schizophrenia.
The use of biofeedback techniques to treat an array of
disorders has been extensively described in the medical lit-
erature. Controlled studies for some applications are limit-
ed, such as for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and
premenstrual disorder (PMS). There is also some debate
over the effectiveness of biofeedback in ADHD treatment,
and the lack of controlled studies on that application. While
many therapists, counselors, and mental health profession-
als have reported great success with treating their ADHD
patients with neurofeedback techniques, some critics
attribute this positive therapeutic impact to a placebo effect.
There may also be some debate among mental
health professionals as to whether biofeedback should be
considered a first line treatment for some mental illness-
es, and to what degree other treatments, such as medica-
tion, should be employed as an adjunct therapy.

Bipolar disorder
Definition
Bipolar, or manic-depressive disorder, is a mood dis-
order that causes radical emotional changes and mood
swings, from manic highs to depressive lows. The major-
ity of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes
of maniaand depression.
Description
In the United States alone, bipolar disorder afflicts
almost two million people at an annual cost of over $45
billion, according to a report by the National Institutes of
Mental Health. The average age of onset of bipolar disor-
der is from adolescence through the early twenties. How-
ever, because of the complexity of the disorder, a correct
diagnosis can be delayed for several years or more. In a
survey of bipolar patients conducted by the National
Depressive and Manic Depressive Association
(MDMDA), one-half of respondents reported visiting
three or more professionals before receiving a correct
diagnosis, and over one-third reported a wait of ten years
or more before they were correctly diagnosed.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders,Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the diagnostic stan-
dard for mental health professionals in the United States,
defines four separate categories of bipolar disorder: bipo-
lar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia, and bipolar not-otherwise-
specified (NOS).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	485
Bipolar disorder
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 485  Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic
episodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. A
bipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings of
self-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased socia-
bility, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities,
coupled with the characteristics of irritability, impa-
tience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreased
need for sleep. Usually this manic period is followed by
a period of depression, although a few bipolar I individu-
als may not experience a major depressive episode.
Mixed states, where both manic or hypomanic symptoms
and depressive symptoms occur at the same time, also
occur frequently with bipolar I patients (for example,
depression with the racing thoughts of mania). Also, dys-
phoric mania is common (mania characterized by anger
and irritability).
Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres-
sive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, a
milder form of mania. Bipolar depression may be diffi-
cult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressive
episode. Patients with bipolar depression tend to have
extremely low energy, retarded mental and physical
processes, and more profound fatigue(for example,
hypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked by a need for
excessive sleep or sleepiness when awake) than unipolar
depressives.
Cyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic
episodes with depression that does not reach major depres-
sive proportions. A third of patients with cyclothymia will
develop bipolar I or II disorder later in life.
A phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up
to 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,
manic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently;
at least 4 times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic defi-
nition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the patient
may bounce between manic and depressive states several
times within a 24-hour period. This condition is very
hard to distinguish from mixed states.
Bipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do
not clearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia diag-
noses.
Causes and symptoms
The source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly
defined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have a
family history of affective or emotional disorders,
researchers have searched for a genetic link to the disor-
der. Several studies have uncovered a number of possible
genetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar dis-
order. Another possible biological cause under investiga-
tion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up in
the cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and other
neurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated in
bipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation.
Over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder
have a history of substance abuse. There is a high rate of
association between cocaineabuse and bipolar disorder.
Some studies have shown up to 30% of abusers meeting
the criteria for bipolar disorder. The emotional and physi-
cal highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to the
manic depression of the bipolar patient, making the dis-
order difficult to diagnosis.
For some bipolar patients, manic and depressive
episodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressive
episodes are typical during winter and fall, and manic
episodes are more probable in the spring and summer
months.
Symptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include
low energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen-
trating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation
(slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manic
episodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lack
of inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need for
sleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. In
extreme cases, mania can induce hallucinationsand
other psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.
Diagnosis
Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by
a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis-
tance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven-
tories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mental
status and determine the presence of bipolar symptoms.
These include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory
III (MCMI-III),Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
InventoryII (MMPI-2), the Internal State Scale (ISS),
the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI), and the Young
Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/or
written and are administered in both hospital and outpa-
tient settings.
Psychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri-
teria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) as a guide-
line for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mental
illnesses. DSM-IVdescribes a manic episode as an
abnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period of
at least one week that is distinguished by at least three of
the mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreased
need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis-
tractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces-
sive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a
high potential for painful consequences. If the mood of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2486
Bipolar disorder
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 486  the patient is irritable and not elevated, four of the symp-
toms are required.
Although many clinicians find the criteria too rigid,
a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration of at least four
days with at least three of the symptoms indicated for
manic episodes (four if mood is irritable and not elevat-
ed). DSM-IVnotes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman-
ic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza-
tion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,
because hypomanic episodes are characterized by high
energy and goal directed activities and often result in a
positive outcome, or are perceived in a positive manner
by the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.
Bipolar symptoms often present differently in chil-
dren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groups
are typically characterized by more psychotic features
than in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz-
ophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-
tability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,
symptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather than
acute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,
impulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-
nosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Furthermore, their aggression often leads to violence,
which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.
Substance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-
scription or over-the-counter medication can mask or
mimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-
stance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-
od of detoxificationand abstinence before a mood disor-
der is diagnosed and treatment begins.
Treatment
Treatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of
medication. A combination of mood stabilizing agents
with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants
is used to regulate manic and depressive episodes.
Mood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-
mazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the
manic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:
• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,
Lithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-
quently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of
bipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takes
four to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-
stream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction with
neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepinesto provide more
immediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has also
been shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres-
sion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithium
may not be an effective long-term treatment option for
rapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, or
may not respond to it. Possible side effects of the drug
include weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors.
Prolonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism
(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita-
tions, nervousness, the presence of goiter, sweating,
and a wide array of other symptoms.)
• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant
drug usually prescribed in conjunction with other mood
stabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-
lar patients who have not responded well to lithium
therapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movement
are two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.
As of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA-
cleared indication for mania.
• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic
acid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available that
has been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-
lar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribed
alone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi-
um. Stomach cramps,indigestion,diarrhea, hair loss,
appetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain are
some of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val-
proate is also approved for the treatment of mania.
Because antidepressants may stimulate manic
episodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typically
short-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) or, less often,monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar
depression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo-
lar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar
patients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatment
option for bipolar depression.
• SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft),
and paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulating
levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety, diarrhea,
drowsiness,headache, sweating, nausea, sexual prob-
lems, and insomniaare all possible side effects of SSRIs.
• MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel-
zine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase
(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system.
Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine
(found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to
avoid hypotensive side effects.
• Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres-
sant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the drug
is not known, but it has been effective in regulating
bipolar depression in some patients. Side effects of
bupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor,
dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, and
insomnia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	487
Bipolar disorder
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 487  • ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, has a high success
rate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depression,
and mania. However, because of the convenience of
drug treatment and the stigma sometimes attached to
ECT therapy, ECT is usually employed after all phar-
maceutical treatment options have been explored. ECT
is given under anesthesia and patients are given a mus-
cle relaxant medication to prevent convulsions. The
treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses that
move into the brain through electrodes on the patient’s
head. Although the exact mechanisms behind the suc-
cess of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that
this electrical current alters the electrochemical
processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres-
sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confu-
sion are possible side effects immediately following an
ECT procedure. Temporary memory loss has also been
reported in ECT patients. In bipolar patients, ECT is
often used in conjunction with drug therapy.
Adjunct treatments are used in conjunction with a
long-term pharmaceutical treatment plan:
• Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klon-
apin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid treat-
ment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients until
mania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizing
agents can take effect. Sedationis a common effect, and
clumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are other
possible side effects of benzodiazepines.
• Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and
haloperidol (Haldol) are also used to control mania
while a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproate
takes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can be
severe (difficulty in speaking or swallowing,paralysis
of the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms,
severe restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremors
in fingers and hands, twisting movements of body, and
weakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are gener-
ally preferred over neuroleptics.
• Psychotherapy and counseling. Because bipolar disorder
is thought to be biological in nature, therapy is recom-
mended as a companion to, but not a substitute for, phar-
maceutical treatment of the disease. Psychotherapy, such
as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be a useful tool in
helping patients and their families adjust to the disorder,
in encouraging compliance to a medication regimen, and
in reducing the risk of suicide. Also, educative counsel-
ing is recommended for the patient and family.
Calcium channel blockers(nimodipine, or Nimo-
top), typically used to treat anginaand hypotension,have
been found effective, in a few small studies, for treating
rapid cyclers. Calcium channel blockers stop the excess
calcium build up in cells that is thought to be a cause of
bipolar disorder. They are usually used in conjunction with
other drug therapies such as carbamazepine or lithium.
Clozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic
medication used to control manic episodes in patients
who have not responded to typical mood stabilizing
agents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic, or
preventative treatment, in some bipolar patients. Common
side effects of clozapine include tachycardia (rapid heart
rate), hypotension,constipation, and weight gain. Agran-
ulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversible condition
in which the white blood cells that typically fight infec-
tion in the body are destroyed, is a possible side effect of
clozapine. Patients treated with the drug should undergo
weekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts.
Risperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychotic
medication that has been successful in controlling mania
in several clinical trials when low doses were adminis-
tered. The side effects of risperidone are mild compared
to many other antipsychotics (constipation, coughing,
diarrhea, dry mouth, headache,heartburn, increased
length of sleep and dream activity, nausea, runny nose,
sore throat, fatigue, and weight gain).
Lamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsant
medication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a
1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug was used in
conjunction with divalproex (divalproate) and/or lithium.
Possible side effects of lamotrigine include skin rash,
dizziness, drowsiness, headache,nausea and vomiting.
rTMS, or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation
is a new and still experimental treatment for the depres-
sive phase of bipolar disorder. In rTMS, a large magnet is
placed on the patient’s head and magnetic fields of dif-
ferent frequency are generated to stimulate the left front
cortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, rTMS requires no anes-
thesia and does not induce seizures.
Alternative treatment
General recommendations include maintaining a
calm environment, avoiding over stimulation, getting
plenty of rest, regular exercise, and proper diet. Chinese
herbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedbackis effective
in helping some patients control symptoms such as irri-
tability, poor self control, racing thoughts, and sleep
problems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral found in
meats and other foods) and high in vitamin C may be
helpful in reducing depression.
Prognosis
While most patients will show some positive response
to treatment, response varies widely, from full recovery to a
complete lack of response to all drug and/or ECT therapy.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2488
Bipolar disorder
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 488  Drug therapies frequently need adjustment to achieve the
maximum benefit for the patient. Bipolar disorder is a
chronic recurrent illness in over 90% of those afflicted, and
one that requires lifelong observation and treatment after
diagnosis. Patients with untreated or inadequately treated
bipolar disorder have a suicide rate of 15-25% and a nine-
year decrease in life expectancy. With proper treatment, the
life expectancy of the bipolar patient will increase by nearly
seven years and work productivity increases by ten years.
Prevention
The ongoing medical management of bipolar disor-
der is critical to preventing relapse, or recurrence, of
manic episodes. Even in carefully controlled treatment
programs, bipolar patients may experience recurring
episodes of the disorder. Patient education in the form of
psychotherapy or self-help groups is crucial for training
bipolar patients to recognize signs of mania and depres-
sion and to take an active part in their treatment program.

Birth defects
Definition
Birth defects are physical abnormalities that are pre-
sent at birth; they are also called congenital abnormali-
ties. More than 3,000 have been identified.
Description
Birth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborn
infants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches
10% by age five, as more defects become evident and can
be diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns are
caused by birth defects.
Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or part
of the body. Major defects are structural abnormalities
that affect the way a person looks and require medical
and/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are abnormali-
ties that do not cause serious health or social problems.
When multiple birth defects occur together and have a
similar cause, they are called syndromes. If two or more
defects tend to appear together but do not share the same
cause, they are called associations.
Causes and symptoms
The specific cause of many congenital abnormalities
is unknown, but several factors associated with pregnan-
cyand delivery can increase the risk of birth defects.
Teratogens
Any substance that can cause abnormal develop-
ment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a terato-
gen. In the first two months after conception, the devel-
oping organism is called an embryo; developmental	stages from two months to birth are called fetal. Growth	is rapid, and each body organ has a critical period in	which it is especially sensitive to outside influences.	About 7% of all congenital defects are caused by expo-	sure to teratogens.
DRUGS.Only a few drugs are known to cause birth
defects, but all have the potential to cause harm. Thalido-
mide is known to cause defects of the arms and legs; sev-
eral other types also cause problems.
• Alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol while preg-
nant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcohol
syndrome, which include mental retardation, heart
problems, and growth deficiency.
•Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens.
Tetracycline affects bone growth and discolors the
teeth. Drugs used to treat tuberculosiscan lead to hear-
ing problems and damage to a nerve in the head (cra-
nial). Sulfa drugs are associated with abnormally high
levels of bilirubin in the newborn, which can cause
death.
• Anticonvulsants. Drugs given to prevent seizures can
cause serious problems in the developing fetus, includ-
ing mental retardation and slow growth.
• Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents. Several drugs
given for anxietyand mental illness are known to cause
specific defects.
• Antineoplastic agents. Drugs given to treat cancercan
cause major congenital malformations, especially central
nervous system defects. They may also be harmful to the
health care worker who is giving them while pregnant.
• Hormones. Male hormones may cause masculinization
of a female fetus. A synthetic estrogen (DES) given in
the 1940s and 1950s causes an increased risk of cancer
in the adult female children of the mothers who
received the drug.
• Recreational drugs. Drugs such as LSDhave been asso-
ciated with arm and leg abnormalities and central ner-
vous system problems in infants. Crack cocainehas
also been associated with birth defects. Since drug
abusers tend to use many drugs and have poor nutri-
tionand prenatal care, it is hard to determine the effects
of individual drugs.
CHEMICALS.Environmental chemicals such as
fungicides, food additives, and pollutants are suspected
of causing birth defects, though this is difficult to prove.
RADIATION.Exposure of the mother to high levels of
radiation can cause small skull size (microcephaly), blind-
ness,spina bifida, and cleft palate. How severe the defect
is depends on the duration and timing of the exposure.

developing baby:rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and
herpes simplex. Toxoplasma gondii,a parasite that can be
contracted from undercooked meat, from dirt, or from
handling the feces of infected cats, causes serious prob-
lems. Untreated syphilisin the mother is also harmful.
Genetic factors
A gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing informa-
tion (DNA) that guides how the body forms and func-
tions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genes
from each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes. Genes
control all aspects of the body, how it works, and all its
unique characteristics, including eye color and body size.
Genes are influenced by chemicals and radiation, but
sometimes changes in the genes are unexplained acci-
dents. Each child gets half of its genes from each parent.
In each pair of genes one will take precedence (domi-
nant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait,
or characteristic. Birth defects caused by dominant inher-
itance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla-
sia; high cholesterol; Huntington’s disease, a progres-
sive nervous system disorder; Marfan syndrome, which
affects connective tissue; some forms of glaucoma, and
polydactyly (extra fingers or toes).
If both parents carry the same recessive gene, they
have a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit the
disease. Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to an
early death. They include sickle cell anemia, a blood disor-
der that affects blacks, and Tay-Sachs disease, which
causes mental retardation in people of eastern European
Jewish heritage. Two recessive disorders that affect mostly
whites are:cystic fibrosis, a lung and digestive disorder,
and phenylketonuria(PKU), a metabolic disorder. If only
one parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the nor-
mal gene received from the other parent will prevent the
disease, but the child will be a carrier. Having the gene is
not harmful to the carrier, but there is the 25% chance of
the genetic disease showing up in the child of two carriers.
Some disorders are linked to the sex-determining
chromosomes passed along by parents. Hemophilia,a
condition that prevents blood from clotting, and
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which causes muscle
weakness, are carried on the X chromosome. Genetic

The specific cause of many birth defects is unknown, but several factors associated with pregnancy and delivery can
increase the risk of birth defects. These factors include exposure to teratogens, drugs and other chemicals, exposure to radi-
ation, and infections present in the womb.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 491  defects can also take place when the egg or sperm are
forming if the mother or father passes along some faulty
gene material. This is more common in older mothers.
The most common defect of this kind is Down syn-
drome, a pattern of mental retardation and physical
abnormalities, often including heart defects, caused by
inheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than the
normal pair.
A less understood cause of birth defects results from
the interaction of genes from one or both parents plus
environmental influences. These defects are thought to
include:
• Cleft lip and palate, which are malformations of the
mouth
• Clubfoot, ankle or foot deformities.
• Spina bifida, an open spine caused when the tube that
forms the brain and spinal chord does not close properly.
• Water on the brain (hydrocephalus), which causes
brain damage.
•Diabetes mellitus, an abnormality in sugar metabolism
that appears later in life.
• Heart defects.
• Some forms of cancer.
A serious illness in the mother, such as an underac-
tive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body can-
not process sugar, can also cause birth defects in the child.
An abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate or
cause birth defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur-
rounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too lit-
tle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop-
ment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if the
fetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing.
Diagnosis
If there is a family history of birth defects or if the
mother is over 35 years old, then screening tests can be
done during pregnancy to gain information about the
health of the baby.
• Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test that
measure the level of a substance called alpha-fetopro-
tein that is associated with some major birth defects. An
abnormally high or low level may indicate the need for
further testing.
• Ultrasound. The use of sound waves to examine the
shape, function, and age of the fetus is a common proce-
dure. It can also detect many malformations, such as
spina bifida, limb defects, and heart and kidney problems.
• Amniocentesis. This test is usually done between the
13th and 15th weeks of pregnancy. A small sample of
amniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needle
inserted into the mother’s abdomen. Chromosomal
analysis can rule out Down syndrome and other genetic
conditions.
• Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be done
as early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identify
chromosome disorders and some genetic conditions. A
thin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slim
tube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tis-
sue sample for testing.
If a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born,
then confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. The
patient’s medical records and medical history may hold
essential information. A careful physical examination
and laboratory tests should be done. Special diagnostic
tests can also provide genetic information in some cases.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of birth defect and
how serious it is. When an abnormality has been identi-
fied before birth, then delivery can be planned at a health
care facility that is prepared to offer any special care
needed. Some abnormalities can be corrected with
surgery. Experimental procedures have been used suc-
cessfully in correcting some defects, like excessive fluid
in the brain (hydrocephalus), even before the baby is

the help of experienced medical and educational special-
ists with an understanding of the disorder.
Prognosis
The prognosis for a disorder varies with the specific
condition.
Prevention
Pregnant women should eat a nutritious diet. Taking
folic acidsupplements before and during pregnancy
reduces the risk of having a baby with serious problems
of the brain or spinal chord (neural tube defects). It is
important to avoid any teratogen that can harm the devel-
oping baby, including alcohol and drugs. When there is a
family history of congenital defects in either parent, then
genetic counselingand testing can help parents plan for

Birthmarks
Definition
Birthmarks, including angiomas and vascular mal-
formations, are benign (noncancerous) skin growths
composed of rapidly growing or poorly formed blood
vessels or lymph vessels. Found at birth (congenital) or
developing later in life (acquired) anywhere on the body,
they range from faint spots to dark swellings covering
wide areas.
Description
Skin angiomas, also called vascular (pertaining to
vessel) nevi (marks), are composed of blood vessels
(hemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas), that
lie beneath the skin’s surface. Hemangiomas, composed
of clusters of cells that line the capillaries, the body’s
smallest blood vessels, are found on the face and neck
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	493
Birthmarks
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 493  (60%), trunk (25%), or the arms and legs (15%). Con-
genital hemangiomas, 90% of which appear at birth or
within the first month of life, grow quickly, and disap-
pear over time. They are found in 1-10% of full-term
infants, and 25% of premature infants. About 65% are
capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks), 15% are cav-
ernous (deep) hemangiomas, and the rest are mixtures.
Hemangiomas are three times more common in girls.
Usually, only one hemangioma is found, in 20% two are
found, while fewer than 5% have three or more. Lym-
phangiomas are skin bumps caused by enlarged lymph
vessels anywhere on the body.
Vascular malformations are poorly formed blood or
lymph vessels that appear at birth or later in life. One
type, the salmon patch (nevus simplex), a pink mark
composed of dilated capillaries, is found on the back of
the neck (also called a stork bite) in 40% of newborns,
and on the forehead and eyelids (also called an angel’s
kiss) in 20%. Stork bites are found in 70% of white and
60% of black newborns.
Found in fewer than 1% of newborns, port-wine
stains (nevus flammeus), are vascular malformations
composed of dilated capillaries in the upper and lower
layers of the skin of the face, neck, arms, and legs. Often
permanent, these flat pink to red marks develop into dark
purple bumpy areas in later life; 85% appear on only one
side of the body.
Acquired hemangiomas include spider angiomas
(nevus araneus), commonly known as spider veins, and
cherry angiomas (senile angiomas or Campbell de Mor-
gan spots). Found around the eyes, cheekbones, arms,
and legs, spider angiomas are red marks formed from
dilated blood vessels. They occur during pregnancyin
70% of white women and 10% of black women, in alco-
holics and liver disease patients, and in 50% of children.
Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries found mainly on the
trunk, appear in the 30s, and multiply with aging.
Causes and symptoms
There are no known causes for congenital skin
angiomas; they may be related to an inherited weakness of
vessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider angiomas
in pregnant women or those taking oral contraceptives.
Spider angiomas tend to run in families, and may be asso-
ciated with liver disease, sun exposure, and trauma.
Hemangiomas
Hemangiomas first appear as single or multiple,
white or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (average
2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while others
cause painor bleeding, or interfere with normal function-
ing when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or ulcer-
ated. Vision is affected by large marks on the eyelids. Spi-
der and cherry angiomas are unsightly but symptomless.
Each type of hemangioma has a characteristic
appearance:
• Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks). These
round, raised marks are bright red and bumpy like a
strawberry, and become white or gray when fading.
• Cavernous hemangiomas. These slightly raised, dome-
shaped, blue or purple swellings are sometimes associ-
ated with lymphangiomas or involve the soft tissues,
bone, or digestive tract.
• Spider angiomas. These are symptomless, reddish blue
marks formed from blood-filled capillaries radiating
around a central arteriole (small artery) in the shape of
a spider web.
• Cherry angiomas. These harmless, dilated capillaries
appear as tiny, bright red-to-violet colored bumps.
• Lymphangiomas. These dilated lymph vessels form light
pink or yellow cysts (fluid- filled sacs) or swellings.
Vascular malformations
These are faint, flat, pink stains that grow as the
child grows into larger dark red or purple marks. Some
are symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured.
Disfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional and
social problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on the
forehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due to
involvement of the eye and surrounding nerves. Abnor-
malities of the spinal cord, soft tissues, or bone may be
associated with severe port-wine stains.
Each type has a characteristic appearance:
• Salmon patches. These symptomless, light red-to-pink
marks usually fade with time.
• Port-wine stains. These flat, pink marks progress to
raised, dark red-to-purple grape-like lumps distorting
the facial features, arms, or legs.
Diagnosis
Patients are treated by pediatricians (doctors who
specialize in the care of children), dermatologists (skin
disease specialists), plastic surgeons (doctors who spe-
cialize in correcting abnormalities of the appearance),
and ophthalmologists (eye disease specialists).
Angiomas and vascular malformations are not diffi-
cult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medical
history and performs a physical examinationincluding
inspection and palpation of the marks. The skin is exam-
ined for discoloration, scarring, bleeding, infection, or

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 494  ulceration. The type, location, size, number, and severity
of the marks are recorded. The doctor may empty the
mark of blood by gentle pressure. Biopsies or specialized
x rays or scans of the abnormal vessels and their sur-
rounding areas may be performed. Patients with port-
wine stains near the eye may require skull x rays,com-
puted tomography scans, and vision and central ner-
vous system tests. Most insurance plans pay for diagno-
sis and treatment of these conditions.
Treatment
Treatment choices for skin angiomas and vascular
malformations depend on their type, location, and severity,
and whether they cause symptoms, pain, or disfigurement.
Watchful waiting
No treatment is given, but the mark is regularly exam-
ined. This continues until the mark disappears, or requires
treatment. This approach is particularly appropriate for the
treatment of hemangiomas, which often do not require
treatment, since they eventually shrink by themselves.
Drugs
CORTICOSTEROIDS.Daily doses of the anti-inflam-
matory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are given for up
to 2 months with gradual reduction of the dose. The marks
begin to subside within 7-10 days, but may take up to 2
months to fully disappear. If no response is seen in 2
weeks, the drug is discontinued. Treatment may be repeat-
ed. Side effects include growth retardation, increased blood
pressure and blood sugar,cataracts, glandular disorders,
and infection. The corticosteroidstriamcinolone acetate
and betamethasone sodium phosphate or acetate are inject-
ed directly into the marks with a response usually achieved
within a week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks.
Side effects include tissue damage at the injection site.
INTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell
growth, and is used for vascular marks that affect vision,
and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids. Given in daily
injections under the skin, a response rate of 50% is
achieved after about 7 months. Side effects include fever,
chills, muscle and joint pain, vision disorders, low white
and red blood cell counts,fatigue, elevated liver enzymes,
nausea, blood clotting problems, and nerve damage.
ANTIBIOTICS.Oral or topical (applied to the skin)
antibioticsare prescribed for infected marks.
Surgery
LASER SURGERY.Lasers create intense heat that
destroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin, with-
out damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers are used:
the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and the neodymi-
um:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. The FPDL, used mainly for
strawberry marks and port-wine stains, penetrates to a
depth of 1.8 mm and causes little scarring, while the
Nd:YAG laser penetrates to a depth of 6 mm, and is used
to treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgeryis not usually
painful, but can be uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream is
used for FPDL treatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAG
laser requires local or general anesthesia. Children are
usually sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2
weeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration,
swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.
SURGICAL EXCISION.Under local or general anes-
thesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument, and vas-
cular marks or their scars are removed. The cut is
repaired with stitches or skin clips.
CRYOSURGERY.Vascular marks are frozen with an
extremely cold substance sprayed onto the skin. Wounds
heal with minimal scarring.
ELECTRODESICCATION. Affected vessels are des-
troyed with the current from an electric needle.
Other treatments
These include:
• Sclerotherapy. Injection of a special solution causes
blood clotting and shrinkage with little scarring. Side
effects include stinging, swelling, bruising, scarring,
muscle cramping, and allergic reactions. This treatment
is used most commonly for spider angiomas.
• Embolization. Material injected into the vessel blocks
blood flow which helps control blood loss during or
reduces the size of inoperable growths. A serious side

becomes blocked.
• Make-up. Special brands are designed to cover birth-
marks (Covermark or Dermablend).
• Cleaning and compression. Bleeding marks are cleaned
with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide, and com-
pressed with a sterile bandage for 5-10 minutes.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for strengthening weak blood
vessels include eating high-fiber foods and those con-
taining bioflavonoids, including citrus fruit, blueberries,
and cherries, supplementing the diet with vitamin C, and
taking the herbs, ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) and bilberry
(Vaccinium myrtillus.)
Prognosis
The various types of birthmarks have different prog-
noses:
• Capillary hemangiomas. Fewer than 10% require treat-
ment. Without treatment, 50% disappear by age 5, 70%
by age 7, and 90% by age 9. No skin changes are found
in half while others have some discoloration, scarring,
or wrinkling. From 30-90% respond to oral corticos-

Congenital hemangiomas or vascular malformations
cannot be prevented, but spider angiomas may be pre-
vented by exercise, weight control, and a high-fiber diet,
as well as avoidance of sun exposure, alcohol drinking,
or wearing tight hosiery.

Bites and stings
Definition
Humans can be injured by the bites or stings of
many kinds of animals, including mammals such as
dogs, cats, and fellow humans; arthropods such as spi-
ders, bees, and wasps; snakes; and marine animals such
as jellyfish and stingrays.
Description
Mammals
DOGS.In the United States, where the dog popula-
tion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammals
in the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,
most dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey of
U.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers to
estimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medical
attention occurred in the United States that year, versus
757,000 that did require medical treatment. Studies also
show that most dog bites are from pets or other dogs
known to the bitten person, that males are more likely
than females to be bitten, and that children face a greater
risk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,	mostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.
Dog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency-
room visits annually throughout the United States. More
than half of the bites seen by emergency departments
occur at home. Children under 10 years old, especially
boys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more likely than
older people to visit an emergency room for bite treat-
ment. Children under 10 years old were also much more
liable to be bitten on the face, neck, and head. Nearly all
of the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment in
emergency rooms were of “low severity,” and most were
treated and released without being admitted to hospital or
sent to another facility. Many of the bites resulted from
people attempting to break up fights between animals.
CATS.Although cats are found in nearly a third of
U.S. households, cat bites are far less common than dog
bites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps
400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year. The
tissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, but
they carry a high risk of infection. Whereas the infection
rate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the infection rate for
cat bites is 30-40%. A typical person who has been bitten
is a young girl playing with a pet.
HUMANS.Bites from mammals other than dogs and
cats are uncommon, with one exception—human bites.
There are approximately 70,000 human bites each year
in the United States. Because the human mouth contains
a multitude of potentially harmful microorganisms,
human bites are more infectious than those of most other
animals.
Arthropods
Arthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy-
lum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids, crus-
taceans, and other subgroups. There are more than
700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite or
sting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs,
fleas, mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, cen-
tipedes, scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, and
wasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most often
bite people.
SPIDERS.In the United States, only two kinds of ven-
omous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders and
brown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow, which
is found in every state but Alaska, is probably the most
notorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry places such as
barns, garages, and outhouses, and also lives under rocks
and logs. Disturbing a female black widow or its web
may provoke a bite. Brown spiders also prefer sheltered
places, including clothing, and may bite if disturbed.

defend their nests or if they are disturbed. Species com-
mon to the United States include honeybees, bumble-
bees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets,
and paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized bee
species, also called “killer bees” that are now found in
the United States since 1990. More than fifty Americans
die each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.
Almost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reac-
tions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.
Snakes
There are 20 species of venomous snakes in the
United States. These snakes are found in every state
except Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about
8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but no
more than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.
The venomous snakes of the United States are divid-
ed into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers) and the
Elapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensing
pit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsible
for about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered by
Americans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths
(also called water moccasins) are pit vipers. This family
of snakes delivers its venom through two long, hinged
fangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers carry a potent
venom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord. The
venom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful.
The Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven-
omous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and west-
ern states. Because coral snakes are bashful creatures
that come out only at night, they almost never bite
humans, and are responsible for approximately 25 bites a
year in the United States. Coral snakes also have short
fangs and a small mouth, which lowers the risk of a bite
actually forcing venom into a person’s body. However,
their venom is quite poisonous.
Marine animals
Several varieties of marine animal may bite or sting.
Jellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat to
people who live or vacation in coastal communities.
Causes and symptoms
Mammals
DOGS.A typical dog bite results in a laceration, tear,
puncture, or crush injury. Bites from large, powerful dogs
may even cause fracturesand dangerous internal
injuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedly
during a single episode. Infected bites usually cause pain,
cellulitis(inflammation of the connective tissues), and a
pus-filled discharge at the wound site within 8-24 hours.
Most infections are confined to the wound site, but many
of the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can cause
systemic and possibly life-threatening infections. Exam-
ples are bacteremiaand meningitis, especially severe in
people diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiencysyn-
drome (AIDS) or other health condition that increases
their susceptibility to infection. Rabiesis rare among pet
dogs in the United States, most of which have been vacci-
nated against the disease. Tetanusis also rare but can be
transmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized.
CATS.The mouths of cats and dogs contain many of
the same microorganisms. Cat scratches and bites are
also capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselaebac-
terium, which can lead to cat-scratch disease,an
unpleasant but usually not life-threatening illness.
Cat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands.
Sharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncture
wound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones, which
are vulnerable to infection because of their comparatively
poor blood supply. This is why cat bites are much more
likely to become infected than dog bites. Also, people are
less inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiring
immediate attention; the risk that infection has set in by
the time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater.
HUMANS.Humans bites result from fights, sexual
activity, medical and dental treatment, and seizures. Bites
also raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse. Chil-
dren often bite other children, but those bites are hardly
ever severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting a
wide range of dangerous diseases, including hepatitis B,
syphilis, and tuberculosis.
Human bites fall into two categories: occlusional
(true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former present
a lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very infec-
tious and can permanently damage the hand, usually
result from a fist hitting teeth during a fight. People often
wait before seeking treatment for a clenched-fist injury,
with the result that about half of such injuries are infect-
ed by the time they are seen by a medical professional.
Arthropods
SPIDERS.As a rule, people rarely see a black widow
bite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The first (and
possibly only) evidence that a person has been bitten may
be a mild swelling of the injured area and two red punc-
ture marks. Within a short time, however, some victims
begin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity of
the abdominal muscles. Other possible symptoms include
excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and
vertigo as well as breathing, vision, and speech problems.

Bites and stings
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 498  A brown spider’s bite can lead to necrotic arachni-
dism, in which the tissue in an area of up to several inch-
es around the bite becomes necrotic (dies), producing an
open sore that can take months or years to disappear. In
most cases, however, the bite simply produces a hard,
painful, itchy, and discolored area that heals without
treatment in 2-3 days. The bite may also be accompanied
by a fever, chills,edema(an accumulation of excess tis-
sue fluid),nausea and vomiting,dizziness, muscle and
joint pain, and a rash.
BEES AND WASPS.The familiar symptoms of bee
and wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and itch-
iness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can have
much more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis,a
life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersen-
sitive persons.
Snakes
Venomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell
within 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Other
symptoms include skin blisters and discoloration, weak-
ness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness, bruising, and
tender lymph nodes. Severe poisoningcan also lead to
tingling in the scalp, fingers, and toes, muscle contrac-
tions, an elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, large drops
in body temperature and blood pressure, vomiting of
blood, and coma.
Many pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail to
poison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only a
small amount of venom into the victim’s body. The
wounds, however, can still become infected by the harm-
ful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths.
Coral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see.
One to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person begins to
experience the effects of the venom, which include tingling
at the wound site, weakness, nausea, vomiting, excessive
salivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of the
body can become paralyzed for 6-14 days, causing double
vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking,respiratory
failure, and other problems. Six to eight weeks may be
needed before normal muscular strength is regained.
Marine animals
JELLYFISH.Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs
called nematocysts, which are located on the creature’s
tentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush up
against them. Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usu-
ally result. The pain can continue up to 48 hours. Severe
cases may lead to skin necrosis,muscle spasms and
cramps, vomiting, nausea,diarrhea, headaches, exces-
sive sweating, and other symptoms. In rare instances,
cardiorespiratory failure may also occur.
STINGRAYS.Tail spines are the delivery mechanism
for stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result that can
cause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded in
the wound. A typical stingray injury scenario involves a
person who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and is
lashed in the ankle by its tail. Stingray venom produces
immediate, excruciating pain that lasts several hours.
Sometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction, including
vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in blood
pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat).
Diagnosis
Mammals
DOGS.Gathering information on the circumstances
of a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment. Medical
professionals need to know when the attack occurred (the
chances of infection increase dramatically if the wound
has been left untreated for more than eight hours) and
what led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more like-
ly to be associated with rabies). A person’s general health
must also be assessed, including the tetanus immuniza-
tion history if any, as well as information concerning
possible allergiesto medication and pre-existing health
problems that may increase the risk of infection.
A physical examinationrequires careful scrutiny of
the wound, with special attention to possible bone, joint,
ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel damage
caused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Seri-
ous hand injuries should be evaluated by a specialized
surgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests for identifying
the microorganisms in bite wounds are performed if
infection is present. X rays and other diagnostic proce-
dures may also be necessary.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 499  CATS.The diagnostic procedures used for dog bites
also apply to cat bites.
HUMANS.Testing the blood of a person who has
been bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other dis-
eases is always necessary after a human bite. Ideally, the
biter should be tested as well for the presence of trans-
missible disease. Clenched-fist injuries often require
evaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Because
many people will deny having been in a fight, medical
professionals usually consider lacerations over the fourth
and fifth knuckles—the typical result of a clenched-fist
injury—to be evidence of a bite wound. Medical profes-
sionals also look for indications of spousal or child
abusewhen evaluating human bites.
Arthropods
SPIDERS.Because bites from widow spiders and
brown spiders require different treatments, capturing and
identifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.
Snakes
Diagnosis relies on a physical examination of the
victim, information about the circumstances of the bite,
and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be killed and
brought in for identification). Blood tests and urinalysis
supply important data on the victim’s condition. Chest x-
rays and electrocardiography(a procedure for measur-
ing heart activity) may also be necessary.
Treatment
Mammals
DOGS.Minor dog bites can be treated at home. The
American Academy of Family Physicians recommends
gently washing the wound with soap and water and then
applying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel
to stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibiotic
ointment and a sterile bandage to the wound. To reduce
swelling and fend off infection, ice should be applied and
the injured area kept elevated above the level of the heart.
The wound should be cleaned and covered with ointment
twice a day until it heals.
Any dog bite that does not stop bleeding after 15
minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical profes-
sional. The same is true for bites that are deep or gaping;
for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for bites that
may have broken a bone, damaged nerves, or caused a
major injury of another kind. Bite victims must also
watch for infection. A fever is one sign of infection, as
are redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, and
pus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS or
cancer, individuals who have not had a tetanus shot in
five years, and anyone else who has a medical problem
that can increase susceptibility to infection should seek
medical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears.
Medical treatment of dog bites involves washing the
wound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of dead
and damaged tissue (under local, regional, or general
anesthetic) may be required after the wound has been
washed, and any person whose tetanus shots are not up to
date should receive a booster injection. Some wounds are
left open and allowed to heal on their own, while others
require stitches (stitching may be delayed a few days if
infection is a concern). Many emergency departments
prescribe antibioticsfor all people with dog bites, but
some researchers suggest that antibiotics are usually
unnecessary and should be limited to those whose
injuries or other health problems make them likely candi-
dates for infection. A follow-up visit after one or two
days is generally required for anyone who has received
bite treatment.
CATS.Because of the high risk of infection, people
who are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Cat
scratches do not require professional medical treatment
unless the wound appears infected or the scratched per-
son has a weakened immune system.
Medical treatment for cat bites generally follows the
procedures used for dog bites. Experts advise, however,
that cat-bite wounds should always be left open to pre-
vent infection. Persons who have been bitten by cats gen-
erally receive antibiotics as a preventive measure.
HUMANS.Human bites should always be examined
by a doctor. Such bites are usually treated with antibi-
otics and left open because of the high risk of infection.
A person who has been bitten may also require immu-
nization against hepatitis B and other diseases. Persons

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 500  who are being treated for a clenched-fist injury will
require a daily follow-up examination for 3-5 days.
Arthropods
SPIDERS.No spider bite should be ignored. The anti-
dote for severe widow spider bites is a substance called
antivenin, which contains antibodies taken from the
blood serum of horses injected with spider venom. Doc-
tors exercisecaution in using antivenin, however,
because it can trigger anaphylactic shock, a potentially
deadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum
sickness, an inflammatory response that can give rise to
joint pain, a fever,rashes, and other unpleasant, though
rarely serious, consequences.
An antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well,
but it is not yet available in the United States. The drug
dapsone, used to treat leprosy, can sometimes stop the
tissue deathassociated with a brown spider bite. Necrot-
ic areas may need debridement(removal of dead and
damaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications,anti-
histamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are a few of the
other treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bite
from a brown spider or widow spider.
BEES AND WASPS.Most stings can be treated at
home. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scraped
off with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of paper
(using tweezers may push more venom out of the venom
sac and into the wound). The area should be cleaned and
covered with an ice pack. Aspirinand other pain med-
ications, oral antihistamines, and calamine lotion are
good for treating minor symptoms. Putting meat tender-
izer on the wound has no effect.
Persons who have been stung and experience an
allergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medical
history, require immediate medical attention. The danger
signs, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individual
is stung (though possibly not for several hours), include
nausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps, diar-
rhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.
Snakes
Although most snakes are not venomous, any
snakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.
While waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victim
should wash the wound site with soap and water, and
then keep the injured area still and at a level lower than
the heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site nor
should attempts be made to suck out the venom. Making
a cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is important
to stay calm and wait for emergency medical aid if it can
arrive quickly. Otherwise, the victim should proceed
directly to a hospital.
When the victim arrives at a hospital, the medical
staff must determine whether the bite was inflicted by a
venomous snake and, if so, whether envenomation
occurred and how much venom the person has received.

aggressive treatment. Fortunately, the effects of some
snakebites can be counteracted with antivenin. Minor rat-
tlesnake envenomations can be successfully treated with-
out antivenin, as can copperhead and water-moccasin
bites. However, coral snake envenomations and the more
dangerous rattlesnake envenomations require antivenin,
sometimes in large amounts. Other treatment measures
include antibiotics to prevent infection and a tetanus
booster injection.

ments, antihistamine creams, and steroid lotions applied
to the skin are sometimes beneficial. Other measures
may be necessary to counter the many harmful effects of
jellyfish stings, which, if severe, require emergency med-
ical care.
STINGRAYS.Stingray wounds should be washed
with saltwater and then soaked in very hot water for 30-
90 minutes to neutralize the venom. Afterwards, the
wound should be examined by a doctor to ensure that no
pieces of spine remain.
Alternative treatment
Arthropods
Several alternative self-care approaches are used to
treat minor bee, wasp, and other arthropod stings, includ-
ing aromatherapy,ayurvedic medicine,flower reme-
dies, herbs,homeopathy, and nutritional therapy.
Prognosis
Mammals
Prompt treatment and recognizing that even appar-
ently minor bites can have serious consequences are the
keys to a good outcome after a mammal bite. Infected
bites can be fatal if neglected. Surgery and hospitaliza-
tion may be needed for severe bites.
Arthropods
SPIDERS.Even without treatment, adults usually
recover from black widow bites after 2-3 days. Those
most at risk of dying are very young children, the elderly,
and people with high blood pressure. In the case of
brown spider bites, the risk of death is greatest for chil-
dren, though rare.
BEES AND WASPS.The pain and other symptoms of a
bee or wasp sting normally fade away after a few hours.
People who are allergic to such stings, however, can
experience severe and occasionally fatal anaphylaxis.
Snakes
A snakebite victim’s chances of survival are excel-
lent if medical aid is obtained in time. Some bites, how-
ever, result in amputation, permanent deformity, or loss
of function in the injured area.
Marine animals
STINGRAYS.Stingray venom kills its human victims
on rare occasions.
Prevention
Mammals
DOGS.The risk of a dog bite injury can be reduced
by avoiding sick or stray dogs, staying away from dog-
fights (people often get bitten when they try to separate the
animals), and not behaving in ways that might provoke or
upset dogs, such as wrestling with them or bothering them
while they are sleeping, eating, or looking after their pup-
pies. Special precautions need to be taken around infants
and young children, who must never be left alone with a
dog. Pit bulls, rottweilers, and German shepherds (respon-
sible for nearly half of all fatal dog attacks in the United
States in 1997-2000) are potentially dangerous pets in
households where children live or visit. For all breeds of
dog, obedience training as well as spaying or neutering
lessen the chances of aggressive behavior.
CATS.Prevention involves warning children to stay
away from strange cats and to avoid rough play and other
behavior that can anger cats and cause them to bite.
Arthropods
SPIDERS.Common-sense precautions include clear-
ing webs out of garages, outhouses, and other places
favored by venomous spiders; keeping one’s hands away
from places where spiders may be lurking; and, when
camping or vacationing, checking clothing, shoes, and
sleeping areas.
BEES AND WASPS.When possible, avoid the nests of
bees and wasps and do not eat sweet food or wear bright
clothing, perfumes, or cosmetics that attract bees and
wasps.
Emergency medical kits containing self-administra-
ble epinephrine to counter anaphylactic shock are avail-
able for allergic people and should be carried by them at
all times. People who suspect they are allergic should
consult an allergist about shots that can reduce reactions
to bee and wasp venom.
Snakes
Snakes should not be kept as pets. Measures such as
mowing the lawn, keeping hedges trimmed, and remov-
ing brush from the yard also discourages snakes from liv-
ing close to human dwellings. Tongs should be used to
move brush, lumber, and firewood, to avoid exposing
one’s hands to snakes that might be lying underneath.
Similarly, golfers should never use their hands to retrieve
golf balls from a water hole, since snakes can be hiding
in the rocks and weeds. Caution is also necessary when
walking through weedy or grassy areas, and children
should be prevented from playing in weedy, vacant lots

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 503  and other places where snakes may live. Leather boots
and long pants offer hikers and campers some protection
from bites. Approaching a snake, even a dead one, can be
dangerous, for the venom of recently killed snakes may
still be active.
Marine animals
JELLYFISH.Prevention of jellyfish stings includes
obeying posted warning signs at the beach. Also, jelly-
fish tentacles may be transparent and up to 120 ft (36.5
m) long, therefore great caution must be exercised when-
ever a jellyfish is sighted nearby.
STINGRAYS.Shuffling while walking through shal-
low areas that may be inhabited by stingrays will disturb
the water, causing the animal to move before it can be
stepped on.

Black lung disease
Definition
Black lung disease is the common name for coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, a
lung disease of older workers in the coal industry,
caused by inhalation, over many years, of small
amounts of coal dust.
Description
The risk of having black lung disease is directly
related to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; the
disease typically affects workers over age 50. Its com-
mon name comes from the fact that the inhalation of
heavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs look
black instead of a healthy pink. Although people who
live in cities often have some black deposits in their
lungs from polluted air, coal miners have much more
extensive deposits.
In the years since the federal government has regu-
lated dust levels in coal mines, the number of cases of
black lung disease has fallen sharply. Since the Federal
Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, average dust
levels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic meter to the
current standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic meter. The 1969
law also set up a black lung disability benefits program
to compensate coal miners who have been disabled by
on-the-job dust exposure.
Despite the technology available to control the
hazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop-
ing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,
however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x
ray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is such
evidence, it often shows up as only small black spots
less than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may have
been caused by smokingrather than coal dust. This
condition is called “simple CWP” and does not lead to
symptoms or disability.
Causes and symptoms
Since the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner

within the lungs or removed from them, builds up. Even-
tually, this build-up causes thickening and scarring,
making the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen to
the blood.
The primary symptom of the disease is shortness of
breath, which gradually gets worse as the disease pro-
gresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop cor pul-
monale, an enlargement and strain of the right side of the
heart caused by chronic lung disease. This may eventual-
ly cause right-sided heart failure.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 505  Some patients develop emphysema(a disease in
which the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged,
leading to shortness of breath, and respiratory and heart
failure) as a complication of black lung disease. Others
develop a severe type of black lung disease called pro-
gressive massive fibrosis, in which damage continues in
the upper parts of the lungs even after exposure to the
dust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure what causes this
serious complication. Some think that it may be due to
the breathing of a mixture of coal and silica dust that is
found in certain mines. Silica is far more likely to lead to
scarring than coal dust alone.
Diagnosis
Black lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a
patient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by a
chest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in the
lungs caused by coal dust are present. A pulmonary
function testmay aid in diagnosis.
X rays can detect black lung disease before it causes
any symptoms. If exposure to the dust is stopped at that
point, progression of the disease may be prevented.
Treatment
There is no treatment or cure for this condition,
although it is possible to treat complications such as lung
infections and cor pulmonale. Further exposure to coal
dust must be stopped.
KEY TERMS
Emphysema—A disease in which the tiny air sacs
in the lungs become damaged, leading to short-
ness of breath, and respiratory and heart failure.
Fibrosis—The growth of scar tissue, often as a
response to injury, infection, or inflammation.
Pulmonary function test—A group of procedures
used to evaluate the function of the lungs and con-
firm the presence of certain lung disorders.
Silica dust—A type of dust from silica (crystalline
quartz) which causes breathing problems in work-
ers in the fields of mining, stone cutting, quarrying
(especially granite), blasting, road and building
construction industries that manufacture abra-
sives, and farming. Breathing the dust causes sili-
cosis, a severe disease that can scar the lungs.
Prognosis
Those miners with simple CWP can lead a normal
life. However, patients who develop black lung disease at
an early age, or who have progressive massive fibrosis,
have a higher risk of premature death.
Prevention
The only way to prevent black lung disease is to
avoid long-term exposure to coal dust. Coal mines may
help prevent the condition by lowering coal dust levels
and providing protective clothes to coal miners.

Bladder cancer
Definition
Bladder canceris a disease in which the cells lining
the urinary bladder lose the ability to regulate their
growth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnormal
growth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.
Description
Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in
the United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS)
estimates that in 1998, approximately 55,000 new cases
of bladder cancer will be diagnosed, and it will cause at
least 12,500 deaths. The disease is three times more com-
mon among men than women, and the incidence is also
higher in caucasians.
The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that
stores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out of
the body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urine
from the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries the
urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
Bladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.
Even after superficial tumors are completely removed,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2506
Bladder cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 506  there is a 75% chance that new tumors will develop in
other areas of the bladder. Hence, patients need very fre-
quent and thorough follow-up care.
Causes and symptoms
Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is not
known, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get
the disease. Hence,smokingis considered the greatest
risk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposed
to certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry and
in the rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries are
believed to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The dis-
ease is also three times more common in men than in
women; caucasians also are at an increased risk. The risk
of bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases are
found in people who are 50–70 years old.
Frequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder
stones, and other conditions that cause long-term irrita-
tion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting blad-
der cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder could
also increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.
One of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is
blood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood in the
urine to change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a
dark red. At other times, the color of the urine appears nor-
mal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presence
of blood cells. A change in bladder habits such as painful
urination, increased frequency of urination and a feeling of
needing to urinate but not being able to do so are some of
the signs of possible bladder cancer. All of these symptoms
may also be caused by conditions other than cancer, but it
is important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluat-
ed. When detected early and treated appropriately, patients
have a very good chance of being cured completely.
Diagnosis
If a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, he
may use several tests to find out if the disease is present. As
a first step, a complete medical history will be taken to
check for any risk factors. A thorough physical examina-
tionwill be conducted to assess all the signs and symp-
toms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to rule
out the presence of a bacterial infection. In a urine cytology
test, the urine is examined under a microscope to look for
any abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can be
advanced into the bladder through the urethra, and a salt
solution is passed through it to wash the bladder. The solu-
tion can then be collected and examined under a micro-
scope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells.
A test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is
an x-ray examination that is done after a dye is injected
into the blood stream through a vein in the arm. The dye
travels through the blood stream and then reaches the
kidneys to be excreted. It clearly outlines the kidneys,

detect any abnormality in the lining of these organs.
The physician may use a procedure known as a cys-
toscopyto view the inside of the bladder. A thin hollow
lighted tube is introduced into the bladder through the
urethra. If any suspicious looking masses are seen, a
small piece of the tissue can be removed from it using a
pair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then examined
microscopically to verify if cancer is present, and if so, to
identify the type of cancer.
If cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate
that it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in the body,
imaging tests such as chest x rays,computed tomography
scans(CT), and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) may
be done to determine which organs are affected. Bladder
cancer generally tends to spread to the lungs, liver, and bone.
Treatment
Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage
of the tumor. The patient’s medical history, overall health
status, and personal preferences are also taken into
account when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan.
The three standard modes of treatment that are available
for bladder cancer are surgery,radiation therapy, and
chemotherapy. In addition, newer treatment methods
such as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy are
also being investigated in clinical trials.
Surgery is considered an option only when the disease
is in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a small area
and has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder, then
the surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen. A
cytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the ure-
thra, and the tumor is removed through it. This procedure is
called a transurethral resection (TUR). Passing a high-ener-
gy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the can-
cer may treat any remaining cancer. This procedure is
known as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded the
walls of the bladder, surgery will be done through an inci-
sion in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can be
removed by partial cystectomy, a procedure where a part
of the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or is present
in more than one area of the bladder, a radical cystectomy
is done. In this operation, besides the entire bladder, the
adjoining organs may also be removed. In men, the prostate
is removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fal-
lopian tubes are removed.
If the entire urinary bladder is removed, then an alter-
nate storage place must be created for the urine to be
stored before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, a
piece of intestine is converted into a small bag and
attached to the ureters. This is then connected to an open-
ing (stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The proce-
dure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures,
the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that is
placed over the stoma in the abdominal wall. The bag is
hidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionally
by the patient. In a different procedure, the urine is collect-
ed in the intestinal sac, but there is no bag on the outside of
the abdomen. The intestinal sac has to be emptied by the
patient, by placing a drainage tube through the stoma.
Radiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to kill
cancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy any
remaining cancer cells that may not have been removed
during surgery. If the tumor is in a location that makes
surgery difficult, or if it is large, radiation may be used
before surgery to shrink the tumor. In cases of advanced
bladder cancer, radiation therapy is used to ease the
symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or blockage. Radiation
can be delivered by external beam radiation where a
source of radiation that is outside the body focuses the
radiation on the area of the tumor. Occasionally, a small
pellet of radioactive material may be placed directly into
the cancer. This is known as interstitial radiation therapy.
Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugsto destroy the
cancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites. The
drugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting them
into a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill form.
Generally a combination of drugs is more effective than any
single drug in treating bladder cancer. Chemotherapy may
be given following surgery to kill any remaining cancer
cells. It may also be given even when no remaining cancer
cells can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
Anticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mit-
omycin, may also be instilled directly into the bladder
(intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat superficial tumors.
Immunotherapy or biological therapy, uses the
body’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treat
superficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG is
a weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosisbacil-
lus that stimulates the body’s immune system to fight the
cancer. This therapy has been shown to be effective in
controlling superficial bladder cancer.
Photodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat-
ment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the can-
cerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the bladder
that makes the cancer cells more susceptible to light. Fol-
lowing that, a special light is shone on the bladder in an
attempt to destroy the cancerous cells.
Prognosis
When detected at the early stages, the prognosis for
bladder cancer is excellent. At least 94% of the people
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2508
Bladder cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 508  survive five years or more after initial diagnosis. Howev-
er, if the disease has spread to the nearby tissues, the sur-
vival rates drop to 49%. If it has metastasized to distant
organs such as the lung, and the liver, commonly only
6% of the patients will survive five years or more.
Prevention
Since we do not know what exactly causes bladder
cancer, there is no certain way to prevent it. Avoiding risk
factors whenever possible is the best alternative.
Since smoking doubles one’s risk of getting bladder
cancer, avoiding tobacco may prevent at least half the
deaths that result from bladder cancer. Taking appropriate
safety precautions when working with organic cancer-caus-
ing chemicals is another way of preventing the disease.
KEY TERMS
Biopsy—The surgical removal and microscopic
examination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.
Chemotherapy—Treatment with drugs that are anti
cancer.
Computed tomography (CT) scan—A medical pro-
cedure where a series of X-rays are taken and put
together by a computer in order to form detailed

and the urinary bladder. An x-ray of the pelvic
region is then taken and any abnormalities of the
urinary tract are revealed.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—A medical
procedure used for diagnostic purposes where pic-
tures of areas inside the body can be created using
a magnet linked to a computer.
Partial cystectomy—A surgical procedure where
the cancerous tissue is removed by cutting out a
small piece of the bladder.
Photodynamic therapy—A novel mode of treatment
where a combination of special light rays and drugs
are used to destroy the cancerous cells. First, the
drugs, which make the cancerous cells more sus-
ceptible to the light rays, are introduced into the
bladder. Then the light is shone on the bladder to
kill the cells.
Radiation therapy—Treatment using high- energy
radiation from X-ray machines, cobalt, radium, or
other sources.
Radical cystectomy—A surgical procedure that is
used when the cancer is in more than one area of
the bladder. Along with the bladder, the adjoining
organs are also removed. In men, the prostate is
removed, while in women, the ovaries, fallopian
tubes and uterus may be removed.
Stoma—An artificial opening between two cavities
or between a cavity and the surface of the body.
Transurethral resection—A surgical procedure to
remove abnormal tissue from the bladder. The tech-
nique involves the insertion of an instrument called
a cytoscope into the bladder through the urethra,
and the tumor is removed through it.
Urostomy—A surgical procedure consisting of cut-
ting the ureters from the bladder and connecting
them to an opening (see Stoma) on the abdomen,
allowing urine to flow into a collection bag.
If a person has had a history of bladder cancer, or
has been exposed to cancer-causing chemicals, then he or
she is considered to be at an increased risk of getting
bladder cancer. Similarly,kidney stones, frequent uri-
nary infections, and other conditions that cause long-
term irritation to the bladder also increases the chance of
getting the disease. In such cases, it is advisable to under-
go regularscreening tests such as urine cytology, cys-
toscopy and x rays of the urinary tract, so that bladder
cancer can be detected at its early stages and treated
appropriately.

Bladder stones
Definition
Bladder stones are crystalline masses that form from
the mineralsand proteins, which naturally occur in
urine. These types of stones are much less common than
kidney stones.
Description
Bladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary
tract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tiny
granules about the size of a grain of sand, but they can
grow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones can
block the flow of urine causing painand difficulty with
urination. They can also scratch the bladder wall, which
may lead to bleeding or infection.
Causes and symptoms
While the exact causes of the formation of bladder
stones are not completely understood, bladder stones
usually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),
obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the
prostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodies
in the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of fluid intake
also appear to be important factors in the development of
bladder stones.
Ninety-five percent of all bladder stones occur in
men, most of who have an enlarged prostategland or a
UTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or in
African Americans. People with goutmay develop blad-
der stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.
The symptoms of bladder stones may become evi-
dent when the wall of the bladder is scratched or when
the urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone. These
symptoms include:
• abnormally dark colored urine
• blood in the urine
• difficulty urinating
• frequent urge to urinate
• lower abdominal pain
• pain or discomfort in the penis
Some people with bladder stones also may experi-
ence an inability to control urination (urinary inconti-
nence).
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after a
physical examination, which may include a rectal exami-
nationto check for enlargement of the prostate gland.
Urine tests are then used to determine if there is blood or
indications of an UTI in the urine. If bladder stones are sus-
pected, bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered. Stones that
are large enough to cause problems with urinary function
are almost always detectable by x ray.
Treatment
Many bladder stones can be passed out of the body
in the urine. People with small bladder stones will be
asked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eight
eight-ounce glasses of water per day to increase urinary
output. If the stones do not pass after two weeks, or if the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2510
Bladder stones
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 510  patient’s symptoms become worse, further medical treat-
ment may be required.
A large bladder stone, or small stone that the patient
cannot pass in the urine, may be broken up into smaller
stones using ultrasound (shock waves). These smaller
stones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot be
broken into pieces by these methods, or that the patient
cannot pass, may have to be surgically removed.
Alternative treatment
Traditional herbal remedies for bladder stones include
celery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete blad-
der emptying may cause bladder stones, many patients
may benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improv-
ing overall bladder function. These include Kegel exercis-
es, which are used to strengthen the muscles involved in
urination; herbal supplements (cornsilk, hydrangea,
juniper berries, parsley, and uva ursi) used to increase
urine flow and flush out sediment from the bladder; and,
the consumption of cranberry juice and/or fresh, unsweet-
ened, lemon juice. Cranberry juice helps to control urinary
tract infection and contains a chemical that coats the walls
of the bladder, making them more resistant to infection.
Lemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system.
Prognosis
Most bladder stones can be, and are, passed out of
the body in the urine without any permanent damage to
the bladder or the rest of the urinary tract. However, most
bladder stones arise from an underlying medical condi-
tion. Therefore, if this medical condition is not corrected
approximately half of all patients will experience a recur-
rence of bladder stones within five years.
Prevention
Bladder stones may, in some cases, be prevented by
the patient receiving prompt medical treatment for an
enlarged prostate gland or UTI. The consumption of at
least six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day
and/or the regular consumption of cranberry juice may
help to prevent recurrences of bladder stones.

Bladder training
Definition
Bladder training is a behavioral modification treat-
ment technique for urinary incontinencethat involves
placing a patient on a toileting schedule. The time inter-
val between urination is gradually increased in order to
train the patient to remain continent.
Purpose
Bladder training is used to treat urinary urge inconti-
nence. Urge incontinence occurs when an individual
feels a sudden need to urinate and cannot control the urge
to do so and, as a consequence, involuntarily loses urine
before making it to the toilet.
Precautions
Incontinence may be controlled through a number of
invasive and non-invasive treatment options, including
Kegel exercises,biofeedback, bladder training, medica-
tion, insertable incontinence devices, and surgery. Each
patient should undergo a full diagnostic work-up to

Bladder training
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 511  determine the type and cause of the incontinence in order
to determine the best course of treatment.
Description
Bladder training may be prescribed and implement-
ed by a general physician, urologist, or urogynecologist.
A urination schedule is created for the patient. The
schedule typically starts out with fairly short intervals
between bathroom breaks (e.g., an hour). As soon as the
patient is able to consistently remain continent for sever-
al days at a certain toileting time interval, the time span
is increased. Bladder training continues until the patient
regularly achieves continence at a time interval he/she
feels comfortable with.
Preparation
A complete evaluation to determine the cause of uri-
nary incontinence is critical to proper treatment. A thor-
ough medical history and physical examinationshould
be performed on patients considering bladder training.
Diagnostic testing may include x rays, ultrasound, urine
tests, and a physical examination of the pelvis. It may
include a series of exams called urodynamic testing that
measure bladder pressure and capacity and the urinary
flow. The patient may also be asked to keep a diary of
their urination output and frequency and episodes of
incontinence over a period of several days or a week.
Risks
Bladder training may not be successful in all
patients with urge incontinence. Patients who demon-
strate a strong desire to control their continence and are
committed to sticking with a training program tend to
have the most success with bladder training.
Normal results
Patients who undergo successful bladder training gain
complete or improved control over their urination. In some

Blastomyces dermatitidis seeBlastomycosis
Blastomycosis
Definition
Blastomycosis is an infection caused by inhaling
microscopic particles (spores) produced by the fungus
Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis may be limited
to the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In its
most severe form, the infection can spread throughout
the body and involve many organ systems (systemic).
Description
Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas-
tomyces dermatitidis. Although primarily an airborne
disease, farmers and gardeners may become infected
from contact with spores in the soil through cuts and
scrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is found in
moist soil and wood in the southeastern United States,
the Mississippi River valley, southern Canada, and Cen-
tral America. Blastomycosis is also called Gilchrist’s dis-

Blastomycosis

Another South and Central American disease, paracoc-
cidioidomycosis, is sometimes called South American
blastomycosis, but despite the similar name, this disease
is substantially different from North American blastomy-
cosis. Canine blastomycosis, a common dog disease, is
caused by the same fungus that infects humans. Howev-
er, people do not get this disease from their dogs except
only very rarely through dog bites.
Blastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about
4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six times more
common in men than in women and tends to more often
infect children and individuals in the 30–50 year old age
group. People who have diabetes mellitusor who are
taking drugs that suppress the immune system (immuno-
compromised) are more likely to develop blastomycosis.
Although people with AIDScan get blastomycosis
because of their weakened immune system, blastomyco-
sis has not been one of the more common fungal infec-
tions associated with AIDS.
Causes and symptoms
Once inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidiscan lodge
in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation. This is
known as primary pulmonary blastomycosis. The disease
does not spread from one person to another. In the early
stages, symptoms may include a dry cough,fever, heavy
sweating,fatigue, and a general feeling of ill health. In
approximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only the
lungs are affected. As the disease progresses, small
lesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep within
the lungs (alveoli) to break down and form small cavities.
In another 35%, the disease involves both the lungs
and the skin. Bumps develop on the skin, gradually
becoming small, white, crusted blisters filled with pus.
The blisters break open, creating abscesses that do not
heal. Approximately 19% of infected people have skin
sores without infection in the lungs.
The remaining approximately 20% of the infected
population has blastomycosis that has spread or dissemi-
nated to other systems of the body. Symptoms may
include painand lesions on one or more bones, the male
genitalia, and/or parts of the central nervous system. The
liver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, and
digestive system may also be infected.
Diagnosis
A positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when
the fungus B. dermatitidisis identified by direct micro-
scopic examination of body fluids such as sputum and
prostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from the
lung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is
to culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of spu-
tum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage, but
alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomy-
cosis because any damage caused by other diseases, such
as by pneumoniaor tuberculosis, may appear look on
the x ray. Because its symptoms vary widely, blastomy-
cosis is often misdiagnosed.
Treatment
Blastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually
lead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto-
conazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in about 75%
of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) given intra-
venously is also very effective, but it has more toxic side
effects than ketoconazole. Treatment with amphotericin
B usually requires hospitalization, and the patient may
also receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses
on creating an internal environment where the fungus
cannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet low
in dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,
and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-
mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncooked
and unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitaminsC, E,
A-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus
acidophilusand Bifidobacteriumwill replenish the good
bacteria in the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, like
garlic (Allium sativum), can be consumed in relatively
large doses and for an extended period of time in order to
increase effectiveness. A variety of antifungal herbs,
such as myrrh (Commiphora molmol), tea tree oil
(Melaleucaspp.), citrus seed extract, pau d’arco tea

directly to the infected skin.
Prognosis
Left untreated, blastomycosis gradually leads to
death. When treated, however, patients begin to improve
within one week and, with intensive treatment, may be
cured within several weeks. The highest rate of recovery
is among patients who only have skin lesions. People
with the disseminated form of the disease are least likely
to be cured and and most likely to suffer a relapse.
Prevention
Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is air-
borne and microscopic, the only form of prevention is to
avoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil. For
many people this is impractical. Since the disease is rare,
people who maintain general good health do not need to
worry much about infection.

Bleeding time
Definition
Bleeding time is a crude test of hemostasis (the arrest
or stopping of bleeding). It indicates how well platelets
interact with blood vessel walls to form blood clots.
Purpose
Bleeding time is used most often to detect qualitative
defects of platelets, such as Von Willebrand’s disease. The
test helps identify people who have defects in their
platelet function. This is the ability of blood to clot fol-
lowing a wound or trauma. Normally, platelets interact
with the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clot.
There are many factors in the clotting mechanism, and
they are initiated by platelets. The bleeding time test is
usually used on patients who have a history of prolonged
bleeding after cuts, or who have a family history of bleed-
ing disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimes
performed as a preoperative test to determine a patient’s
likely bleeding response during and after surgery. Howev-
er, in patients with no history of bleeding problems, or
who are not taking anti-inflammatory drugs, the bleeding
time test is not usually necessary.
Precautions
Before administering the test, patients should be
questioned about what medications they may be taking.
Some medications will adversely affect the results of the
bleeding time test. These medications include anticoagu-
lants,diuretics,anticancer drugs,sulfonamides, thi-
azide,aspirinand aspirin-containing preparations, and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The test may
also be affected by anemia (a deficiency in red blood
cells). Since the taking of aspirin or related drugs are the
most common cause of prolonged bleeding time, no
aspirin should be taken two weeks prior to the test.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2514
Bleeding time
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 514  Description
There are four methods to perform the bleeding
test. The Ivy method is the traditional format for this
test. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is placed
on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM Hg. A lancet or
scalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on the
underside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loaded
blade device is most commonly used to make a stan-
dard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that no
superficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, because
of their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial-
ly in people with bleeding defects. The time from when
the stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped is
measured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec-
onds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw off
the blood. The test is finished when bleeding has
stopped completely.
The three other methods of performing the bleeding
test are the template, modified template, and Duke
methods. The template and modified template methods
are variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure cuff
is used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in the
Ivy method. A template is placed over the area to be
stabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm using
the template as a location guide. The main difference
between the template and the modified method is the
length of the cut made.
For the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear lobe
or a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in the Ivy
method, the test is timed from the start of bleeding until
bleeding is completely stopped. The disadvantage to the
Duke method is that the pressure on the blood veins in
the stab area is not constant and the results achieved are
less reliable. The advantage to the Duke method is that
no scar remains after the test. The other methods may
result in a tiny, hairline scar where the wound was made.
However, this is largely a cosmetic concern.
Preparation
There is no special preparation required of the
patient for this test. The area to be stabbed should be
wiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should be
left on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at the
wound site. The alcohol must be removed before stab-
bing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect the
tests results by inhibiting clotting.
Aftercare
If a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown
factors or diseases, further testing is required to identify
the exact cause of the bleeding problem.
KEY TERMS
Hemostasis—The stopping of bleeding or blood
flow through a blood vessel or organ.
Normal results
A normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less
than five minutes from the time of the stab until all
bleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend the
normal range to eight minutes. Normal values for the
template method range up to eight minutes, while for
the modified template methods, up to 10 minutes is
considered normal. Normal for the Duke method is
three minutes.
Abnormal results
A bleeding time that is longer than normal is an
abnormal result. The test should be stopped if the patient
hasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes. Bleeding time
is longer when the normal function of platelets is
impaired, or there are a lower-than-normal number of
platelets in the blood.
A longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate
that one of several defects in hemostasis is present,
including severe thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunc-
tion, vascular defects, Von Willebrand’s disease, or other
abnormalities.

Bleeding varices
Definition
Bleeding varices are bleeding, dilated (swollen)
veins in the esophagus (gullet), or the upper part of the
stomach, caused by liver disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	515
Bleeding varices
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 515  Description
Engorged veins are called varices (plural of varix).
Varices may occur in the lining of the esophagus, the
tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, or in the
upper part of the stomach. Such varices are called
esophageal varices. These varices are fragile and can
bleed easily because veins are not designed to handle
high internal pressures.
Causes and symptoms
Liver disease often causes an increase in the blood
pressure in the main veins that carry blood from the
stomach and intestines to the liver (portal veins). As the
pressure in the portal veins increases, the veins of the
stomach and esophagus swell, until they eventually
become varices. Bleeding varices are a life-threatening
complication of this increase in blood pressure (portal
hypertension). The most common cause of bleeding
varices is cirrhosisof the liver caused by chronic alcohol
abuse or hepatitis. Bleeding varices occur in approxi-
mately one in every 10,000 people.
Symptoms of bleeding varices include
• vomiting blood, sometimes in massive amounts
• black, tarry stools
• decreased urine output
KEY TERMS
Cirrhosis of the liver—A type of liver disease, most
often caused by chronic alcohol abuse. It is charac-
terized by scarring of the liver, which leads to an
increase in the blood pressure in the portal veins.
Endoscopy—Medical imaging technique for visual-
izing the interior of a hollow organ.
Esophagus—The tube in the body which takes food
from the mouth to the stomach.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)—An imaging
test that involves visually examining the lining of
the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum with
a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.
Portal hypertension—Portal hypertension forces the
blood flow backward, causing the portal veins to
enlarge and the emergence of bleeding varices
across the esophagus and stomach from the pressure
in the portal vein. Portal hypertension is most com-
monly caused by cirrhosis, but can also be seen in
portal vein obstruction from unknown causes.
Portal veins—The main veins that carry blood from
the stomach and intestines to the liver.
Shock—A state of depression of the vital processes
of the body characterized by pallor, a rapid and
weak pulse, rapid and shallow respiration, and low-
ered blood pressure. Shock results from severe trau-
ma, such as crushing injuries, hemorrhage, burns,
or major surgery.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS)—A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS) is a radiology procedure in which a
tubular device is inserted in the middle of the liver
to redirect the blood flow.
Varices—A type of varicose vein that develops in
veins in the linings of the esophagus and upper stom-
ach when these veins fill with blood and swell due to
an increase in blood pressure in the portal veins.
• excessive thirst
• nausea
• vomiting
• and blood in the vomit
If bleeding from the varices is severe, a patient may
go into shockfrom the loss of blood, characterized by
pallor, a rapid and weak pulse, rapid and shallow respira-
tion, and lowered systemic blood pressure.
Diagnosis
Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient who
has any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and who has
either been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or who
has a history of prolonged alcohol abuse. The definitive
diagnosis is established via a specialized type of endo-
scopy, namely,esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD), a
procedure that involves the visual examination of the lin-
ing of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum
with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.
Treatment
The objective during treatment of bleeding varices is
to stop and/or prevent bleeding and to restore/maintain
normal blood circulation throughout the body. Patients
with severe bleeding should be treated in intensive care
since uncontrolled bleeding can lead to death.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2516
Bleeding varices
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 516  Initial treatment of bleeding varices begins with stan-
dard resuscitation, including intravenous fluids and blood
transfusions as needed. Definitive treatment is usually
endoscopic, with the endoscope used to locate the sites of
the bleeding. An instrument, inserted along with the endo-
scope, is used either to inject these sites with a clotting
agent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands.
Repeated endoscopic treatments (usually four to six)
are generally required to eliminate the varices and to pre-
vent the recurrence of bleeding. These endoscopic tech-
niques are successful in about 90 percent of cases.
Patients who cannot be treated endoscopically may
be considered for an alternative procedure called TIPS
(transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). This pro-
cedure involves placing a hollow metal tube (shunt) in
the liver connecting the portal veins with the hepatic
veins (veins that leave the liver and drain to the heart).
This shunt lowers the pressure in the portal veins and
prevents bleeding and portal hypertension. The TIPS pro-
cedure is performed by a radiologist and has become an
accepted method for reducing portal vein pressure since
1992. Although the procedure continues to evolve, TIPS
can routinely be created in more than 93% of patients.
Medications aimed at controlling bleeding may also
be prescribed. These include propanolol, vasopressin,
octreotide acetate, and isosorbide mononitrate.
Alternative treatment
Some alternative treatments are aimed at preventing
the cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding varices
and most are effective. However, once a patient has
reached the bleeding varice stage, standard intervention to
stop the bleeding is required or the patient may die.
Prognosis
Bleeding varices represent one of the most feared
complications of portal hypertension. They contribute to
the estimated 32,000 deaths per year attributed to cirrho-
sis. Half or more of patients who survive episodes of
bleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal bleed-
ing during the first one to two years. The risk of recur-
rence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug treatment.
Prognosis is usually more related to the underlying liver
disease. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with
bleeding varices will die from this condition within the
six weeks of the first bleeding episode.
Prevention
The best way to possibly prevent the development or
recurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk fac-
tors for cirrhosis of the liver. The most common cause of
cirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse, and alcohol con-
sumption must be completely eliminated. People with
hepatitis Bor hepatitis Calso have an increased risk of
developing cirrhosis of the liver. Vaccinationagainst
hepatitis B and avoidance of intravenous drug usage
reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis.

Blepharoplasty
Definition
Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure that
removes fat deposits, excess tissue, or muscle from the
eyelids to improve the appearance of the eyes.
Purpose
The primary use of blepharoplasty is for improving
the cosmetic appearance of the eyes. In some older
patients, however, sagging and excess skin surrounding
the eyes can be so extensive that it limits the range of
vision. In those cases, blepharoplasty serves a more func-
tional purpose.
Precautions
Before performing blepharoplasty, the surgeon will
assess whether the patient is a good candidate for the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	517
Blepharoplasty
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 517  treatment. A good medical history is important. The sur-
geon will want to know about any history of thyroid dis-
ease,hypertension, or eye problems, which may
increase the risk of complications.
Description
Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or
lower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin
and fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles
surrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more
youthful appearance.
The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess
skin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault. While
the patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will mark on the
skin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken to
hide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above and
below the eye. The patient then receives injections of a
local anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give
the patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.
After a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin
is removed, the surgeon will work to tease out small
pockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If muscle
looseness is also a problem, the surgeon may trim tissue
or add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision is
closed with stitches.
In some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid may
be the only or primary problem. Such patients may be
good candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. In
this procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur-
face of the eyelid, but instead enters from behind to tease
out the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantage
of this procedure is that there is no visible scar.
Preparation
Prior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon to
discuss the procedure, clarify the results that can be
achieved, and discuss the potential problems that might
occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any
cosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that
although blepharoplasty can improve the appearance of
the eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel,
will be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles
around the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C and
vitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief that
this helps the healing process. Patients are also told to
stop smokingin the weeks before and after the proce-
dure, and to refrain from alcohol and aspirin.
Aftercare
An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of stitch-
es for several days after surgery. Patients also take an

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 518  antibiotic several times a day to prevent infection. Ice-
cold compresses are applied to the eyes continuously for
the first day following surgery, and several times a day for
the next week or so, to reduce swelling. Some swelling
and discoloration around the eyes is expected with the
procedure. Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic bev-
erages for one week and should limit their activities,
including bending, straining, and lifting. The stitches are
removed a few days after surgery. Patients can generally
return to their usual activities within a week to 10 days.
Risks
As with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty can
lead to infection and scarring. Good care of the wound fol-
lowing surgery can minimize these risks. In cases where
too much skin is removed from the eyelids, the patient
may have difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndrome
may develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to lubri-
cate the eye. In a rare complication, called retrobulbar
hematoma, a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball.
Normal results
Most patients can expect good results from blepharo-
plasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat pro-
ducing a more youthful appearance. Some swelling and
discoloration is expected immediately following the pro-
cedure, but this clears in time. Small scars will be left
where the surgeon has made incisions; but these generally
lighten in appearance over several months, and, if placed
correctly, will not be readily noticeable.
Abnormal results
As noted, if too much excess skin is removed from
the upper eyelid, the patient may be unable to close his
eyes completely; another surgery to correct the defect
may be required. Similarly, too much skin can be
removed from the lower eyelid, allowing too much of the
white of the eye (the sclera) to show. In extreme cases,
the lower lid may be pulled down too far, revealing the
underlying tissue. Called an ectropion, this, too, may
require a second, corrective surgery. The eye’s ability to
make tears may also be compromised, leading to dry eye
syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is potentially dangerous; in
rare cases it leads to damage to the cornea of the eye and
vision loss.

Blood-viscosity reducing drugs
Definition
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs are medicines that
improve blood flow by making the blood less viscous
(sticky).
Purpose
The main use of blood-viscosity reducing drugs is to
relieve painful leg cramps caused by poor circulation, a
condition called intermittent claudication. Physicians
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	519
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 519  also may prescribe this medicine for other conditions,
including stroke,impotence, male infertility,Ray-
naud’s disease, and nerve and circulation problems
caused by diabetes.
Description
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs are available only
with a physician’s prescription and come in extended-
release tablet form. Examples of blood-viscosity reducing
drugs are pentoxifylline (Trental) and oxypentifylline.
Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults is 400 mg, two to three
times a day, with meals. However, the dose may be dif-
ferent for different patients. Check with the physician
who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the
prescription for the correct dosage. Dosages for children
must be determined by a physician.
Taking an antacid with this medicine may help pre-
vent upset stomach.
Precautions
This medicine may relieve leg painthat results from
poor circulation, but it should not be considered a substi-
tute for other treatments the physician recommends, such
as physical therapy or surgery.
This medicine may take several weeks to produce
noticeable results. Be sure to keep taking it as directed,
even if it doesn’t seem to be helping.
Patients being treated with this medicine should not
smoke, as smokingmay worsen the conditions for which
the medicine is prescribed.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to pentoxi-
fylline, aminophylline,caffeine, dyphylline, ethylenedi-
amine (contained in aminophylline), oxtriphylline, theo-
bromine, or theophylline in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking a blood-viscosity reducing
drug. The physician should also be told about any aller-
giesto foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
KEY TERMS
Raynaud’s disease—A blood vessel disorder in
which the fingers and toes become numb and turn
white when exposed to cold.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians
before using a blood-viscosity reducing drug.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of this medicine, which may increase the chance
of side effects.
Before using blood-viscosity reducing drugs, people
with any of these medical problems should make sure
their physicians are aware of their conditions:
• recent stroke
• any condition in which there is an increased chance of
bleeding
• kidney disease
• liver disease
Side effects
Minor discomforts, such as dizziness,headache,
upset stomach, nausea, or vomiting usually go away as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment unless they persist or they interfere with nor-
mal activities.
More serious side effects are rare. However, if these
or any other unusual or troublesome symptoms occur,
check with the physician who prescribed the medicine as
soon as possible:
• chest pain
• irregular heartbeat
Interactions
Blood-viscosity reducing drugs may interact with a
other medicines, changing the effects of one or both of
the drugs or increasing the risk of side effects. Anyone
who takes blood-viscosity reducing drugs should let the
physician know all other prescription or nonprescription
(over-the-counter) medicines he or she is taking. Among
the drugs that may interact with blood-viscosity reducing
drugs are:
• anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin)(also called
blood thinners or clot inhibitors)
• calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem (Cardizem),
used to treat high blood pressure
• angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such
as enalapril (Vasotec), used to treat high blood pressure
• theophylline (Theo-Dur)
• medicines such as cimetidine (Tagamet), taken for
ulcers or heartburn

Definition
One of the most commonly ordered clinical labora-
tory tests, a blood count, also called a complete blood
count (CBC), is a basic evaluation of the cells (red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets) suspended in the
liquid part of the blood (plasma). It involves determining
the numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the differ-
ent types of blood cells.
Purpose
The CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test
that is often done as part of a routine physical examina-
tion. It can provide valuable information about the blood
and blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow),
as well as other body systems. Abnormal results can indi-
cate the presence of a variety of conditions—including
anemias, leukemias, and infections—sometimes before
the patient experiences symptoms of the disease.

A complete blood count is actually a series of tests
in which the numbers of red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are count-
ed. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content and
the packed cell volume (hematocrit) of the red blood
cells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood cells,
and determines the types and percentages of white blood
cells. Components of the complete blood count (hemo-
globin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) can
also be tested separately, and are sometimes done that
way when a doctor wants to monitor a specific condition,
such as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed with
leukemia, or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recent-
ly received a blood transfusion. Because of its value,
though, as an indicator of a person’s overall health, the
CBC package is most frequently ordered.
The blood count is performed relatively inexpen-
sively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use some
type of automated equipment to dilute the blood, sample
a measured volume of the diluted suspension, and count
the cells in that volume. In addition to counting actual
numbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, the auto-
mated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin and
calculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices
(measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the red
blood cells). Technologists then examine a stained blood
smear under the microscope to identify any abnormali-
ties in the appearance of the red blood cells and to report
the types and percentages of white blood cells observed.
The red blood cell (RBC) count determines the total
number of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of blood.
The red cells, the most numerous of the cellular ele-
ments, carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues.
Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-iron compound in the
red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen. Its
concentration corresponds closely to the RBC count.
Also closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values is
the hematocrit (Hct), which measures the percentage of
red blood cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit
(expressed as percentage points) is normally about three
times the hemoglobin concentration (reported as grams
per deciliter).
Red blood cell indices provide information about the
size and hemoglobin content of the red cells. They are
useful in differentiating types of anemias. The indices
include four measurements that are calculated using the
RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit results. Mean
corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the aver-
age size of the red blood cells and indicates whether that
is small, large or normal. The red blood cell distribution
width (RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBC
size. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures the
average amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a red
blood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the aver-
age concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.
The white blood cell (WBC) count determines the
total number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood

the body’s primary means of fighting infection. There are
five main types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes,
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of which
plays a different role in responding to the presence of
foreign organisms in the body. A differential white cell
count is done by staining a smear of the patient’s blood
with a Wright’s stain, allowing the different types of
white cells to be clearly seen under the microscope. A
technologist then counts a minimum of 100 WBCs and
reports each type of white cell as a percentage of the total
white blood cells counted.
The platelet countis an actual count of the number
of platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.
Platelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,
are involved in blood clotting. Because platelets can
clump together, the automated counting method is sub-
ject to a certain level of error and may not be accurate
enough for low platelet counts. For this reason, very low
platelet levels are often counted manually.
Normal results
Blood count values can vary by age and sex. The
normal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2–5.4 million
RBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6–5.0 mil-
lion for women. Hemoglobin values range from 14–18
grams per deciliter of blood for men and 12–16 grams for
women. The normal hematocrit is 42–54% for men and
36–48% for women. The normal number of white blood
cells for both men and women is approximately
4,000–10,000 WBCs per microliter of blood.
Abnormal results
Abnormal blood count results are seen in a variety of
conditions. One of the most common is anemias, which
are characterized by low RBC counts, hemoglobins, and
hematocrits. Infections and leukemias are associated
with increased numbers of WBCs.

Blood culture
Definition
A blood culture is done when a person has symp-
toms of a blood infection, also called bacteremia. Blood
is drawn from the person one or more times and is tested
in a laboratory to find and identify any microorganism
present and growing in the blood. If a microorganism is
found, more testing is done to determine the antibiotics
that will be effective in treating the infection.
Purpose
Bacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can
lead to death. To give the best chance for effective treat-
ment and survival, a blood culture is done as soon as an
infection is suspected.
Symptoms of bacteremia are fever, chills, mental
confusion,anxiety, rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,
blood clotting problems, and shock. These symptoms are
especially significant in a person who already has anoth-
er illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has trouble
fighting infections because of a weak immune system.
Often, the blood infection results from an infection
somewhere else in the body that has now spread.
Additionally, blood cultures are done to find the
causes of other infections. These include bacterial pneu-
monia(an infection of the lung), and infectious endo-
carditis(an infection of the inner layer of the heart).
Both of these infections leak bacteria into the blood.
After a blood infection has been diagnosed, con-
firmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood cul-
ture may be done to make sure the infection is gone.
Description
Culture strategies
There are many variables involved in performing a
blood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn, the
physician must make several decisions based on a knowl-
edge of infections and the person’s clinical condition and
medical history.
Several groups of microorganisms, including bacte-
ria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood infections.
The bacteria group can be further broken down into aer-
obes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do not need oxygen to
live. They can grow with oxygen (aerobic microbes) or
without oxygen (anaerobic microbes).
Based on the clinical condition of the patient, the
physician determines what group of microorganisms is
likely to be causing the infection and then orders one or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2522
Blood culture
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 522  more specific types of blood culture, including aerobic,
anaerobic, viral, or fungal (for yeasts and molds). Each
specific type of culture is handled differently by the labo-
ratory. Most blood cultures test for both aerobic and
anaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral, and mycobacterial
blood cultures can also be done, but are less common.
The physician must also decide how many blood
cultures should be done. One culture is rarely enough,
but two to three are usually adequate. Four cultures are
occasionally required. Some factors influencing this
decision are the specific microorganisms the physician
expects to find based on the person’s symptoms or previ-
ous culture results, and whether or not the person has had
recent antibiotic therapy.
The time at which the cultures are to be drawn is
another decision made by the physician. During most
blood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microor-
ganisms enter the blood at various time intervals. Blood
drawn randomly may miss the microorganisms. Since
microorganisms enter the blood 30–90 minutes before the
person’s fever spikes, collecting the culture just after the
fever spike offers the best likelihood of finding the
microorganism. The second and third cultures may be
collected at the same time, but from different places on
the person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour intervals,
as the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia,
such as infective endocarditis, microorganisms are always
in the blood and the timing of culture collection is less
important. Blood cultures should always be collected
before antibiotic treatment has begun.
Laboratory analysis
Bacteria are the most common microorganisms
found in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a bacte-
rial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungal
culture and significantly from that of a viral culture.
Blood is drawn from a person and put directly into a
blood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth. After
the laboratory receives the blood culture bottle, several
processes must be completed:
• provide an environment for the bacteria to grow
• detect the growth when it occurs
• identify the bacteria that grow
• test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine
which antibiotic will be effective
There are several types of systems, both manual and
automated, available to laboratories to carry out these
processes.
The broth in the blood culture bottle is the first step
in creating an environment in which bacteria will grow. It
contains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow. If the
physician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow, oxygen
will be kept out of the blood culture bottle; if aerobes are
expected, oxygen will be allowed in the bottle.
The bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at
body temperature. They are watched daily for signs of
growth, including cloudiness or a color change in the
broth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there is
evidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain and
a subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of blood is
removed from the bottle and placed on a microscope
slide. The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained with
purple and red stains and examined under the micro-
scope. If bacteria are seen, the color of stain they picked
up (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan-
gular), and their size provide valuable clues as to what
type of microorganism they are and what antibiotics
might work best. To do the subculture, a drop of blood is
placed on a culture plate, spread over the surface, and
placed in an incubator.
If there is no immediate visible evidence of growth
in the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by doing
gram stains and subcultures. These steps are repeated
daily for the first several days and periodically after that.
When bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it
using biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivity
testing, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is also
done. The bacteria are tested against many different
antibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it.
All information is passed on to the physician as soon
as it is known. An early report, known as a preliminary
report, is usually available after one day. This report will
tell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, the
results of the gram stain. The next preliminary report may
include a description of the bacteria growing on the sub-
culture. The laboratory notifies the physician immediately
when an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity tests
are complete. Sensitivity tests may be complete before the
bacteria is completely identified. The final report may not
be available for five to seven days. If bacteria was found,
the report will include its complete identification and a
list of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive.
One automated system is considered one of the most
important recent technical advances in blood cultures. It
is called continuous-monitoring blood culture systems
(CMCCS). The instruments automatically monitor the
bottles containing the patient blood for evidence of
microorganisms, usually every 10 minutes. Many data
points are collected daily for each bottle, and fed into a
computer for analysis. Sophisticated mathematical calcu-
lations can determine when microorganisms have grown.
This, combined with more frequent blood tests, make it
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	523
Blood culture
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 523  possible to detect microbial growth earlier. In addition,
all CMBCS instruments have the detection system, incu-
bator, and agitation unit in one unit.
Preparation
Ten ml (milliliter) of blood is usually needed for
each blood culture bottle. First a healthcare worker
locates a vein in the inner elbow region. The area of skin
where the blood will be drawn must be disinfected to
prevent any microorganisms on a person’s skin from
entering the blood culture bottle and contaminating it.
The area is disinfected by wiping the area with alcohol in
a circular fashion, starting with tiny circles at the spot
where the needle will puncture the skin and enlarging the
size of the circles while wiping away from the puncture
site. The same pattern of wiping is repeated using an
iodine or iodophor solution. The top of the bottle is disin-
fected using alcohol. After the person’s skin has been
disinfected, the healthcare worker draws the blood and
about 10 ml of blood is injected into each blood culture
bottle. The type of bottles used will vary based on
whether the physician is looking for bacteria (aerobes or
anaerobes), yeast, mold, or viruses.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the
puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.
Warm packs relieve discomfort.
Normal results
Normal results will be negative. A single negative
culture does not rule out a blood infection. False nega-
tives can occur if the person was started on antibiotics
before the blood was drawn, if the environment for

growth was not right, the timing was off, or for some
unknown reason the microorganism just didn’t grow.
Three negative cultures may be enough to rule out bac-
teremia in the case of endocarditis.
Abnormal results
The physician’s skill in interpreting the culture
results and assessing the person’s clinical condition is
essential in distinguishing a blood culture that is positive
because of a true infection from a culture that is positive
because it became contaminated. In true bacteremia, the
patient’s clinical condition should be consistent with a
blood infection caused by the microorganism that was
found. The microorganism is usually found in more than
one culture, it usually grows soon after the bottles are
incubated, and it is often the cause of an infection some-
where else in the person’s body.
When the culture is positive because of contamina-
tion, the patient’s clinical condition usually is not consis-
tent with an infection from the identified microorganism.
In addition, the microorganism is often one commonly
found on skin, it rarely causes infection, it is found in
only one bottle, and it may appear after several days of
incubation. More than one microorganism often grow in
contaminated cultures.

Blood donation and registry
Definition
Blood donation refers to the process of collecting,
testing, preparing, and storing blood and blood compo-
nents. Donors are most commonly unpaid volunteers, but
they may also be paid by commercial enterprises. Blood

Blood donation and registry
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 524  registry refers to the collection and sharing of data about
donated blood and ineligible donors.
Purpose
The purpose of the blood collection and distribution
system is to help ensure an adequate supply of blood for
accident victims, people needing surgery, and people suffer-
ing from certain diseases, as well as for medical research.
Sometimes, donors give blood specifically to benefit
a particular person. People preparing for elective surgery
may donate their own blood to be held and then returned
to them during surgery. This is known as autologous
blood donation. Directed donor blood has been donated
by someone known to the intended recipient, such as a
family member or friend.
Each year, more than four million Americans receive
blood transfusions involving more than 26 million units
of blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about one
pint), or an average of about 32,000 units per day. All of
that blood must be collected, tested, prepared, stored, and
delivered to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight million
people in the United States donate blood each year; about
half of the total amount needed is provided by the 36
regional blood centers of the American Red Cross.
Whole blood and the various blood components have
many uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen, are used
to treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in controlling
bleeding, are commonly used in the treatment of
leukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen plasma is also
used to control bleeding in people deficient in certain
clotting factors. Cryoprecipitated AHF, made from fresh
frozen plasma, contains a few specific clotting factors.
Precautions
To ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi-
tiered process of donor screening and deferral is
employed. This involves donor education, taking a
detailed health history of each prospective donor, and
giving potential donors a simple physical examination
(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test for
anemia). At any point in the process, a potential donor
may be “deferred,” or judged ineligible to donate blood.
This deferral may be temporary or permanent, depending
on the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged to
“self-defer,” or voluntarily decline to donate, rather than
put future blood recipients at risk.
All donated blood is extensively tested before being
used. The first step is determining the blood type, which
indicates who can receive the blood. Receiving the wrong
type of blood can cause death. Blood is also screened for
any antibodies that could cause complications for recipi-
ents. In addition, blood is tested to screen out donors
infected with the following diseases:Hepatitis Bsurface
antigen ADD, hepatitis B core antibody,hepatitis Cvirus
antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24 antigen,
HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and syphilis. Nucleic
Acid Amplification testing is also performed, and other
tests may be done if a doctor requests them.
In order to detect the greatest possible number of
infections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive.
For this reason, however, donors sometimes receive false
positive test results. In these cases, more specific confir-
matory tests are performed, to help rule out false positive
results. Blood found to be abnormal is discarded, and all
items coming into direct contact with donors are used
only once and then discarded. Donors of infected blood
are entered into the Donor Deferral Register, a confiden-
tial national data base used to prevent deferred people
from donating blood.
In general, blood donors must be at least 17 years
old (some states allow younger people to donate blood
with their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110
pounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.
Many factors can temporarily or permanently dis-
qualify potential donors. Most of them have to do with
having engaged in behaviors that put them at risk of
infection or having spent time in certain specified areas.
Among these factors are having had a tattoo, having had
sex with people in high-risk groups, having had certain
diseases, and having been raped.
Description
There are eight different blood types in all—four
ABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive or
Rh negative. These types, and their approximate distribu-
tion in the U.S. population, are as follows: O+ (38%), O-
(7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%), B- (2%), AB+ (3%),
AB- (1%). In an emergency, anyone can safely receive
type O red blood cells, and people with this blood type are
known as “universal donors. “ People with type AB blood,
known as “universal recipients,” can receive any type of
red blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types.
Blood donations can be made in community blood
centers, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which visit
schools, churches and workplaces. The actual process of
donating whole blood takes about 20 minutes. A sterile
needle is inserted into a vein in the donor’s arm. The
blood flows through plastic tubing into a blood bag.
Donors may be asked to clench their fist to encourage
blood to flow. Usually, one unit of blood is collected.
Afterward, donors are escorted to an observation area,
given light refreshments, and allowed to rest.

blood cells, platelets and other elements are suspended, is
also collected, often by commercial enterprises that sell it
to companies manufacturing clotting factors and other
blood products. This is done using a process known as
apheresis, in which whole blood is collected, the desired
blood component is removed, and the remainder is returned
to the donor. Collecting plasma generally takes one to two
hours. Apheresis may also be used to collect other blood
components, such as platelets and granulocytes.
Preparation
Once whole blood has been collected, it is sent to a lab
for testing and processing. Most donated blood is separated
into its constituent components, such as red blood cells,
platelets, and cryoprecipitate. This enables more than one
person to benefit from the same unit of donated blood.
Different blood components vary in how long they
can be stored. Red blood cells can be refrigerated for up
to 42 days or frozen for as much as 10 years. Platelets,
stored at room temperature, may be kept for up to five
days. Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF can
be kept for as much as one year.
Aftercare
It generally takes about 24 hours for the donor’s
body to replenish the lost fluid. Replacing the lost red
blood cells, however, may take as much as two months.
Whole blood donors must wait a minimum of eight
weeks before donating again. Some states place further
limits on the frequency and/or total number of times an
individual may donate blood within a 12-month period.

tem and advances in the effectiveness of screening tests,

Autologous blood donors run a tiny risk of having
the wrong blood returned to them due to clerical error.
There is also a faint possibility of bacterial contamina-

For most donors, the process is quick and painless
and they leave feeling fine. They may also find satisfac-
tion in knowing that they have contributed to the nation’s
blood supply and may even have helped save lives.
Abnormal results
Most blood donors suffer no significant aftereffects.
Occasionally, however, donors feel faint or dizzy, nau-
seous, and/or have pain, redness, or a bruise where the
blood was taken. More serious complications, which
rarely occur, include fainting, muscle spasms, and nerve
damage.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 526  Blood gas analysis
Definition
Blood gas analysis, also called arterial blood gas
(ABG) analysis, is a test which measures the amounts of
oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as the
acidity (pH) of the blood.
Purpose
An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively the
lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how effi-
ciently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from it. The
test also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys are
interacting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal-
ance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi-
ratory disease and other conditions that may affect the
lungs, and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy
(respiratory therapy). In addition, the acid-base compo-
nent of the test provides information on kidney function.
Description
Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from an
artery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content,
oxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH.
Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through
the bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygen
can actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much dis-
solves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (the
pressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries).
Therefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu-
ally measuring how much oxygen the lungs are deliver-
ing to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released into the
blood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The partial
carbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs are
eliminating this carbon dioxide.
The remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in the
blood combines with hemoglobin, a protein—iron com-
pound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen content
measurement in an ABG analysis indicates how much
oxygen is combined with the hemoglobin. A related
value is the oxygen saturation, which compares the
amount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin to
the total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capa-
ble of combining with.
Carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood
than oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate and
smaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in nor-
mal amounts, the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate
creates an acid-base balance in the blood, helping to keep
the pH at a level where the body’s cellular functions are	most efficient. The lungs and kidneys both participate in	maintaining the carbonic acid-bicarbonate balance. The	lungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys reg-	ulate the bicarbonate. If either organ is not functioning	properly, an acid-base imbalance can result. Determina-	tion of bicarbonate and pH levels, then, aids in diagnos-	ing the cause of abnormal blood gas values.
The procedure
The blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture (usu-
ally in the wrist, although it could be in the groin or arm) or
from an arterial line already in place. If a puncture is need-
ed, the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic. A
technician then collects the blood with a small sterile needle
attached to a disposable syringe. The patient may feel a
brief throbbing or cramping at the site of the puncture. After
the blood is drawn, the sample must be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible for analysis.

There are no special preparations. Patients have no
restrictions on drinking or eating before the test. If the
patient is receiving oxygen, the oxygen concentration
must remain the same for 20 minutes before the test; if
the test is to be taken without oxygen, the gas must be
turned off for 20 minutes before the test is taken. The
patient should breathe normally during the test.
Aftercare
After the blood has been taken, the technician or the
patient applies pressure to the puncture site for 10–15
minutes to stop the bleeding, and then places a dressing
over the puncture.The patient should rest quietly while
applying the pressure to the puncture site. Health care
workers will observe the patient for signs of bleeding or
circulation problems
Risks
Risks are very low when the test is done correctly.
Risks include bleeding or bruising at the site, or delayed
bleeding from the site. Very rarely, there may be a prob-
lem with circulation in the puncture area.
Normal results
Normal blood gas values are as follows:
• partial pressure of oxygen (PaO
2): 75–100 mm Hg
• partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO
2): 35–45 mm
Hg
• oxygen content (O
2CT): 15–23%
• oxygen saturation (SaO
2): 94–100%
• bicarbonate (HCO
3): 22–26 mEq/liter
• pH: 7.35–7.45

mal blood pH ranges from 7.35–7.45.
Abnormal results
Values that differ from those listed above may indi-
cate respiratory, metabolic, or kidney disease. These
results also may be abnormal if the patient has experi-
enced trauma that may affect breathing (especially head
and neck injuries). Disorders, such as anemia, that affect
the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, can produce an
abnormally low oxygen content value.

Blood sugar tests
Definition
Blood sugar tests include several different tests that
measure the amount of sugar (glucose) in a person’s
blood. These tests are done either on an empty stomach,
or after consuming a meal or premeasured glucose drink.
Blood sugar tests are done primarily to diagnose and
evaluate a person with diabetes mellitus.
Purpose
The body uses sugar, also called glucose, to supply
the energy it needs to function. People get sugar from
their diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made by
the pancreas and affects the outer membrane of cells,
making it easy for glucose to move from the blood into
the cells. When insulin is active, blood glucose levels fall.
Sugar from body tissues is stored in the form of glycogen.
When glycogen is active, blood glucose levels rise.
After a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply. The
pancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to take
care of all the newly added sugar found in the body. The
insulin moves the sugar out of the blood and into the
cells. Only then does the blood sugar start to level off and

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 528  begin to fall. A person with diabetes mellitus either does
not make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does not
work properly. The result is blood sugar that remains
high, a condition called hyperglycemia.
Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If
left untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes,
kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other body
organs. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, may also be
discovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia is
caused by various hormone disorders and liver disease,
as well as by too much insulin.
Description
There are a variety of ways to measure a person’s
blood sugar.
Whole blood glucose test
Whole blood glucose testing can be performed by a
person in his or her home, and kits are available for this
purpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a finger
stick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A single
drop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrument
called a glucometer. The glucometer quickly determines
the blood sugar and shows the results on a small screen
in usually a few seconds.
Fasting plasma glucose test
The fasting plasma glucose test is done on an empty
stomach. For the eight hours before the test, the person
must fast (nothing to eat or drink, except water). The per-
son’s blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare worker.
The blood sample is collected into a tube containing an
anticoagulant. Anticoagulants stop the blood from clot-
ting. In the laboratory, the tube of blood spins at high
speed within a machine called a centrifuge. The blood
cells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the top.
This straw-colored liquid on the top is the plasma. To
measure the glucose, a person’s plasma is combined with
other substances. From the resulting reaction, the amount
of glucose in the plasma is determined.
Oral glucose tolerance test
The oral glucose tolerance test is done to see how
well the body handles a standard amount of glucose. This
test measures the amount of glucose in a person’s plasma
before and two hours after drinking a large premeasured
beverage containing glucose. The person must eat a con-
sistent diet, containing at least 5.25oz (150 g) of carbohy-
drates each day, for three days before this test. For eight
hours before the test, the person must fast. A healthcare
provider draws the first sample of blood at the end of the
fast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test.
The healthcare provider then gives the person a beverage
containing 2.6 oz (75 g) of glucose. Two hours later, the
person’s blood is drawn again. These blood samples are
centrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor can
then compare the before and after glucose levels to see
how well the body processed the sugar.
Two-hour postprandial blood glucose test
The two-hour postprandial blood glucose test mea-
sures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eats
a specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.
Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it is
difficult to control many factors associated with this test-
ing method.
Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa-
tions including:
• Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American
Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either a
fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance
test be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person already
has symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test without
fasting (called a casual plasma glucose test) may be
done. If the test result is abnormal, it must be confirmed
with another test performed on another day. The two
tests can be different or they can be the same, but they
must be done on different days. If the second test is also
abnormal, the person has diabetes. A two-hour post-
prandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a test
to use for the diagnosis of diabetes. A doctor may order
this test, and follow it with the oral glucose tolerance
test or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results are
abnormal.
• Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs during
pregnancy(gestational diabetes) is dangerous for
both the mother and the baby. Women who may be at
risk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant.
A woman is considered at risk if she is older than 25
years, is not at her normal body weight, has a parent or
sibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic group that
has a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics, Native Ameri-
cans, Asians, African Americans). The blood sugar test
to screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of the
oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting is not required. If
the result is abnormal, a more complete test is done on
another day.
• Testing healthy people. Healthy people without symp-
toms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes when
they are 45 years old and again every three years. Either
the fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test
is used for screening. People in high risk groups should
be tested before the age of 45 and tested more frequently.

Blood sugar tests
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 529  • Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes. The
ADA recommends that a person with diabetes keep the
amount of glucose in the blood at a normal level as much
as possible. This can be done by the diabetic person test-
ing his or her own blood at home one or more times a day.
Preparation
Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a 5
mL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight band
(tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a vein in
the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into that
vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needle
into an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes only
a few minutes.
When fasting is required, the person should have
nothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hours
before the test and until the test or series of tests is com-
pleted. The person should not smoke before or during the
testing period because this can temporarily increase the
amount of glucose in the blood. Other factors that can
cause inaccurate results are a change in diet before the
test, illness or surgery two weeks before the test, certain
drugs, and extended bed rest. The doctor may tell a per-
son on insulin or taking pills for diabetes to stop the
medication until after the test.
Aftercare
After the test or series of tests is completed (and
with the approval of his or her doctor), the person should
eat, drink, and take any medications that were stopped
for the test.
The patient may feel discomfort when blood is drawn
from a vein. Bruising may occur at the puncture site or
the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-
ture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising.
Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.
Risks
If the person experiences any weakness,fainting,
sweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting or
during the test, he or she should immediately tell the per-
son giving the test.
Normal results
Normal results are:
• fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL
• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dL
For the diabetic person, the ADA recommends an ongo-
ing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to 120 mg/dL.
Abnormal results
These abnormal results indicate diabetes and must
be confirmed with repeat testing:
• fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to 126
mg/dL
• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal to
200 mg/dL
• casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symptoms)
less than or equal to 200 mg/dL
• gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less than
or equal to 140 mg/dL
Brain damage can occur from glucose levels below
40 mg/dL and comafrom levels above 470 mg/dL.
Other hormone disorders can cause both hyper-
glycemia and hypoglycemia. Abnormal results must be
interpreted by a doctor who is aware of the person’s med-
ical condition and medical history.

crossmatching
Definition
Blood typing is a laboratory test done to determine a
person’s blood type. If the person needs a blood transfu-
sion, another test called crossmatching is done after the
blood is typed to find blood from a donor that the per-
son’s body will accept.
Purpose
Blood typing and crossmatching are most common-
ly done to make certain that a person who needs a trans-
fusion will receive blood that matches (is compatible
with) his own. People must receive blood of the same
blood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal, transfusion
reaction can occur.
Parents who are expecting a baby have their blood
typed to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of the
newborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as ery-
throblastosis fetalis. Babies who have a blood type dif-
ferent from their mothers are at risk for developing this
disease. The disease is serious with certain blood type
differences, but is milder with others.
A child inherits factors or genes from each parent
that determine his blood type. This fact makes blood typ-
ing useful in paternity testing. To determine whether or
not the alleged father could be the true father, the blood
types of the child, mother, and alleged father are com-
pared.
Legal investigations may require typing of blood or
other body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identify
persons involved in crimes or other legal matters.
Description
Blood typing and crossmatching tests are performed
in a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained in
blood bank and transfusion services. The tests are done
on blood, after it has separated into cells and serum
(serum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clots.)
Costs for both tests are covered by insurance when the
tests are determined to be medically necessary.
Blood bank laboratories are usually located in facili-
ties, such as those operated by the American Red Cross,
that collect, process, and supply blood that is donated, as
well as in facilities, such as most hospitals, that prepare
blood for transfusion. These laboratories are regulated by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and are often inspected and accredited by a professional
association such as the American Association of Blood	Banks (AABB).
Blood typing and crossmatching tests are based on
the reaction between antigens and antibodies. An antigen
can be anything that causes the body to launch an attack,
known as an immune response, against it. The attack
begins when the body builds a special protein, called an
antibody, that is uniquely designed to attack and make
ineffective (neutralize) the specific antigen that caused
the attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make anti-
bodies against its own antigens, only against antigens
that are foreign to it.
A person’s body contains many antigens. The anti-
gens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor-
tant because they determine a person’s blood type. When
red blood cells having a certain blood type antigen are
mixed with serum containing antibodies against that anti-
gen, the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen. In a
test tube, this reaction is observed as the formation of
clumps of cells (clumping).
When blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum are
mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared serum
and cells. Clumping tells which antigens or antibodies
are present and reveals the person’s blood type. When
blood is crossmatched, patient serum is mixed with cells
from donated blood that might be used for transfusion.
Clumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tells
whether or not the blood is compatible.
Although there are over 600 known red blood cell
antigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routine
blood typing and crossmatching is usually concerned
with only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood group
systems.
Blood typing
ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl Land-
steiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined the
serum and red blood cells of his colleagues. From the
reactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered the
ABO blood group system. This discovery earned him the
1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
A person’s ABO blood type—A, B, AB, or O—is
based on the presence or absence of the A and B antigens
on his red blood cells. The A blood type has only the A
antigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen. The
AB blood type has both A and B antigens, and the O
blood type has neither A nor B antigen.
By the time a person is six months old, he naturally
will have developed antibodies against the antigens his
red blood cells lack. That is, a person with A blood type
will have anti-B antibodies, and a person with B blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	531
Blood typing and crossmatching
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 531  type will have anti-A antibodies. A person with AB blood
type will have neither antibody, but a person with O
blood type will have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.
Although the distribution of each of the four ABO blood
types varies between racial groups, O is the most com-
mon and AB is the least common.
ABO typing is the first test done on blood when it is
tested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO-
matched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the major
cause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens are
also found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility is
also important for organ transplants.
An ABO incompatibility between a pregnant woman
and her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causes
no problem for the baby. The structure of ABO antibod-
ies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attack
the baby’s red blood cells.
Paternity testing compares the ABO blood types of
the child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged father
can’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires a
gene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, a
child with blood type B whose mother has blood type O,
requires a father with either AB or B blood type; a man
with blood type O cannot be the true father.
In some people, ABO antigens can be found in body
fluids other than blood, such as saliva and semen. ABO
typing of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations.
RH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,
system was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner and
Wiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeys
into guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens have
since been discovered belonging to this system, making
it the most complex red blood cell antigen system.
In routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,
only one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also known
as the Rh factor or Rh
o[D], is tested for. If the D antigen
is present, that person is Rh-positive; if the D antigen is
absent, that person is Rh-negative.
Other important antigens in the Rh system are C, c,
E, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in rou-
tine blood typing tests. However, testing for the presence
of these antigens is useful in paternity testing, and when
a technologist tries to identify unexpected Rh antibodies

matching is done following blood typing to locate donor blood that the person’s body will accept.(Illustration by Electronic

one or more of these antigens.
Unlike the ABO system, antibodies to Rh antigens
don’t develop naturally. They develop only as an immune
response after a transfusion or during pregnancy.
The incidence of the Rh blood types varies between
racial groups, but not as widely as the ABO blood types:
85% of whites and 90% of blacks are Rh-positive; 15%
of whites and 10% of blacks are Rh-negative.
In transfusions, the Rh system is next in importance
after the ABO system. Most Rh-negative people who
receive Rh-positive blood will develop anti-D antibodies.
A later transfusion of Rh-positive blood could result in a
severe or fatal transfusion reaction.
Rh incompatibility is the most common and severe
cause of HDN. This incompatibility can happen when an
Rh-negative woman and an Rh-positive man produce an
Rh-positive baby. Cells from the baby can cross the pla-
centa and enter the mother’s bloodstream, causing the
mother to make anti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibod-
ies, the structure of anti-D antibodies makes it likely that
they will cross the placenta and enter the baby’s blood-
stream. There, they can destroy the baby’s red blood
cells, causing severe or fatal anemia.
The first step in preventing HDN is to find out the Rh
types of the expectant parents. If the mother is Rh-negative
and the father is Rh-positive, the baby is at risk for devel-
oping HDN. The next step is to test the mother’s serum to
make sure she doesn’t already have anti-D antibodies from
KEY TERMS
ABO blood type—Blood type based on the pres-
ence or absence of the A and B antigens on the red
blood cells.
Antibody—A special protein made by the body as a
defense against foreign material that enters the body.
It is uniquely designed to attack and neutralize the
specific antigen that triggered the immune response.
Antigen—Anything that causes the body to launch
an immune response against that antigen through
the production of antibodies.
Blood bank—A laboratory that specializes in blood
typing, antibody identification, and transfusion ser-
vices.
Blood type—Blood categories based on the pres-
ence or absence of certain antigens on the red
blood cells.
Crossmatch—A laboratory test done to confirm that
blood from a donor and blood from the recipient
are compatible.
Gene—A piece of DNA, located on a chromosome,
that determines how traits such as blood type are
inherited and expressed.
Immune response—The body’s attack against an
antigen that it considers foreign to itself. The attack
begins with the production of antibodies against the
antigen.
Rh blood type—Blood type based on the presence
or absence of the D antigen on the red blood cells.
Transfusion—The therapeutic introduction of blood
or a blood component into a patient’s bloodstream.
a previous pregnancy or transfusion. This procedure is
similar to blood typing. Finally, the Rh-negative mother is
given an injection of Rh Immunoglobulin (RhIg) at 28
weeks of gestation and again after delivery, if the baby is
Rh positive. The RhIg attaches to any Rh-positive cells
from the baby in the mother’s bloodstream, preventing
them from triggering anti-D antibody production in the
mother. An Rh-negative woman should also receive RhIg
following a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy.
OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS. Several other
blood group systems may be involved in HDN and trans-
fusion reactions, although they are much less frequent
than ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy, Kell, Kidd, MNS,
and P systems. Tests for antigens from these systems are
not included in routine blood typing, but they are com-
monly used in paternity testing.
Like Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems do
not develop naturally, but as an immune response after
transfusion or during pregnancy. An antibody screening
test is done before a crossmatch to check for unexpected
antibodies to antigens in these systems. A person’s serum
is mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared cells
containing antigens from these systems. If clumping
occurs, the antibody is identified.
Crossmatching
Crossmatching is the final step in pretransfusion
testing. It is commonly referred to as compatibility test-
ing, or “Type and Cross.”
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	533
Blood typing and crossmatching
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 533  Before blood from a donor and the recipient are
crossmatched, both are ABO and Rh typed. In addition,
antibody screening is done to look for antibodies to cer-
tain Rh, Duffy, MNS, Kell, Kidd, and P system antigens.
If an antibody to one of these antigens is found, only
blood without that antigen will be compatible in a cross-
match. This sequence must be repeated before each
transfusion a person receives.
To begin the crossmatch, blood from a donor with
the same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected. In
a test tube, serum from the patient is mixed with red
blood cells from the donor. If clumping occurs, the blood
is not compatible; if clumping does not occur, the blood
is compatible. If an unexpected antibody is found in
either the patient or the donor, the blood bank does fur-
ther testing to make sure the blood is compatible.
In an emergency, when there is not enough time for
blood typing and crossmatching, O red blood cells may
be given, preferably Rh-negative. O blood type is called
the universal donor because it has no ABO antigens for a
patient’s antibodies to attack. In contrast, AB blood type
is called the universal recipient because it has no ABO
antibodies to attack the antigens on transfused red blood
cells. If there is time for blood typing, red blood cells of
the recipient type (type specific cells) are given. In either
case, the crossmatch is continued, even though the trans-
fusion has begun.
Preparation
To collect the 10 mL blood needed for these tests, a
healthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the patient’s
elbow, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and
inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the
blood through the needle into an attached tube. Collec-
tion of the sample takes only a few minutes.
Blood typing and crossmatching must be done three
days or less before a transfusion. A person doesn’t need to
change diet, medications, or activities before these tests.
He should tell his healthcare provider if, during the last
three months, he has received a blood transfusion or a
plasma substitute, or has had a radiology procedure using
intravenous contrast media. These can give false clump-
ing reactions in both typing and crossmatching tests.
Aftercare
The possible side effects of any blood collection are
discomfort or bruising at the site where the needle punc-
tured the skin, as well as dizzinessor fainting. Bruising
is reduced if pressure is applied with a finger to the punc-
ture site until the bleeding stops. Discomfort is treated
with warm packs to the puncture site.
Risks
There are no risks from the blood collection or test
procedures. Blood transfusions always have the risk of an
unexpected transfusion reaction. A nurse watches a patient
for signs of a reaction during the entire transfusion.
Normal results
There is no normal blood type. The desired result of a
crossmatch is that compatible donor blood is found. Com-
patibility testing procedures are designed to provide the
safest blood product possible for the recipient, but a com-
patible crossmatch is no guarantee that an unexpected
adverse reaction will not appear during the transfusion.
Abnormal results
Except in an emergency, a person cannot receive a
transfusion without a compatible crossmatch result.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 534  Blood urea nitrogen test
Definition
The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the
level of urea nitrogen in a sample of the patient’s blood.
Urea is a substance that is formed in the liver when the
body breaks down protein. Urea then circulates in the
blood in the form of urea nitrogen. In healthy people,
most urea nitrogen is filtered out by the kidneys and
leaves the body in the urine. If the patient’s kidneys are
not functioning properly or if the body is using large
amounts of protein, the BUN level will rise. If the patient
has severe liver disease, the BUN will drop.
Purpose
The BUN level may be checked in order to assess or
monitor:
• the presence or progression of kidney or liver disease.
• blockage of urine flow.
• mental confusion. Patients with kidney failure are
sometimes disoriented and confused.
• abnormal loss of water from the body (dehydration).
• recovery from severe burns. The body uses larger than
normal amounts of protein following serious burns.
Description
The BUN test is performed on a sample of the
patient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuum
tube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,
takes about five minutes.
Preparation
The doctor should check to make sure that the
patient is not taking any medications that can affect BUN
results. These drugs include the antibioticschloram-
phenicol, streptomycin, amphotericin B, methicillin,
gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin, as well as
diureticsand corticosteroids.
The patient should be advised not to eat large
amounts of meat the day before the test.
Aftercare
Aftercare consists of routine care of the area around
the venipuncture.
Risks
The primary risk is the possibility of a bruise or
swelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patient can
apply moist warm compresses.
KEY TERMS
Urea—A compound containing nitrogen that
occurs in the urine and other body fluids as a
result of protein metabolism.
Normal results
Normal BUN levels are 5-18 mg/dL for children; 7-
18 mg/dL for adults; and 8-20 mg/dL in the elderly.
Abnormal results
BUN levels can be too low as well as too high.
Abnormally low BUN
Low levels of BUN may indicate overhydration,
malnutrition,celiac disease[a disease characterized by
the inability ot tolerate foods containing wheat protein
(gluten)], liver damage or disease, or use of corticos-
teroids. Low BUN may also occur in early pregnancy.
Abnormally high BUN
High levels of BUN may indicate kidney disease or
failure; blockage of the urinary tract by a kidney stone or
tumor; a heart attackor congestive heart failure; dehy-
dration; fever; shock; or bleeding in the digestive tract.
High BUN levels can sometimes occur during late preg-
nancy or result from eating large amounts of protein-rich
foods. A BUN level higher than 100 mg/dL points to
severe kidney damage.

Boils
Definition
Boils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hair
follicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (small
blister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle.
Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle is
formed when several furuncles merge to form a single
deep abscesswith several heads or drainage points.
Description
Boils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about
0.2-0.4 in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised above
the skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A boil usually
has a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle is larger and
has several visible heads. Boils occur most commonly on
the face, back of the neck, buttocks, upper legs and groin
area, armpits, and upper torso. Carbuncles are less common
than single boils; they are most likely to form at the back of
the neck. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles.
Boils and carbuncles are common problems in the
general population, particularly among adolescents and
adults. People who are more likely to develop these skin
infections include those with:
• diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin
• alcoholism or drug abuse
• poor personal hygiene
• crowded living arrangements
• jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub-
stances, especially petroleum products
• allergies or immune system disorders, including HIV
infection.
• family members with recurrent skin infections
Causes and symptoms
Boils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus
aureus, a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil
gland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human skin
is usually resistant to bacterial infection,S. aureuscan
enter through a break in the skin surface—including
breaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug
injections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy
creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more
vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be
spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human
contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.
As the infection develops, an area of inflamed tissue
gradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that is
painful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a yellowish	head or point. It may either continue to swell until the	point bursts open and allows the pus to drain, or it may	be gradually reabsorbed into the skin. It takes between	one and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after it	comes to a head and discharges pus. The bacteria that	cause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin or	even into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil is	injured by squeezing. If the infection spreads, the patient	will usually develop chills and fever, swollen lymph
nodes (lymphadenitis), and red lines in the skin running
outward from the boil.
Furunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to
refer to recurrent boils. Many patients have repeated
episodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat because
their nasal passages carry colonies of S. aureus. These
bacterial colonies make it easy for the patient’s skin to be
reinfected. They are most likely to develop in patients
with diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system
disorders.
Carbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev-
eral hair follicles that are close together. Carbunculosis is
a word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop-
ment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until they
merge with each other to form a single large area of
infected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients with
carbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen-
erally unwell.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually
made by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis of
visual examination of the skin. In some cases involving
recurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need to con-
sider acneas a possible diagnosis, but for the most part

Boils
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 536  boils and carbuncles are not difficult to distinguish from
other skin disorders.
S. aureuscan easily be cultured in the laboratory if
the doctor needs to rule out inclusion cysts or deep fun-
gal infections that gardeners sometimes get. The doctor
can make a culture from pus taken from the boil or car-
buncle to confirm the diagnosis of a staphylococcal
infection. He or she can also culture the patient’s nasal
discharge to test for the presence of a S. aureuscolony.
Treatment
Patient and family education
Patient education is an important part of the treatment
of boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned against
picking at or squeezing boils because of the danger of
spreading the infection into other parts of the skin or
bloodstream. It is especially important to avoid squeezing
boils around the mouth or nose because infections in these
areas can be carried to the brain. Patients should also be
advised about keeping the skin clean, washing their hands
carefully before and after touching the boil or carbuncle,
avoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keep-
ing their towels and washcloths separate from those of
other family members. Some doctors may recommend an
antiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected areas.
If the patient has had several episodes of furunculo-
sis, the doctor may examine family members or close
contacts to see if they are carriers of S. aureus. In many
cases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles.
Skin infections and reinfections involving small groups
or clusters of people are being reported more frequently
in the United States.
Medications
Boils are usually treated with application of antibiot-
ic creams—usually clindamycin or polymyxin—follow-
ing the application of hot compresses. The compresses
help the infection to come to a head and drain.
Carbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated with
oral antibioticsas well as antibiotic creams or oint-
ments. The specific medications that are given are usual-
ly dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin (Keflex). Ery-
thromycin may be given to patients who are allergic to
penicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10
days; however, patients with recurrent furunculosis may
be given oral antibiotics for longer periods. Furunculosis
is treated with a combination of dicloxacillin and
rifampin (Rifadin).
Patients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas-
sages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to apply
directly to the lining of the nose.
Surgical treatment
Boils and carbuncles that are very large, or that are
not draining, may be opened with a sterile needle or sur-
gical knife to allow the pus to drain. The doctor will usu-
ally give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife is used;
surgical treatment of boils is painful and usually leaves
noticeable scars.
Alternative treatment
Naturopathic therapy
Naturopathic practitioners usually recommend
changes in the patient’s diet as well as applying herbal
poultices to the infected area. The addition of zinc sup-
plements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to be
effective in treating boils. The application of a paste or
poultice containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis)
root is recommended by naturopaths on the grounds
that goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduce
inflammation.
Homeopathy
Homeopaths maintain that taking the proper homeo-
pathic medication in the first stages of a boil or carbuncle
will bring about early resolution of the infection and pre-
vent pus formation. The most likely choices are Bel-
ladonnaor Hepar sulphuris. If the boil has already
formed,Mercurius vivusor Silicamay be recommended
to bring the pus to a head.
Western herbal therapies
A variety of herbal remedies can be applied topi-
cally to boils to fight infection. These include essential
oils of bergamot (Citrus bergamia), chamomile (Matri-

(Melaleucaspp.). Herbalists also recommend washing
the skin with a mixture of goldenseal and witch hazel.
To fight the inflammation associated with boils,
herbalists suggest marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis)
ointment, tinctures (herbal solutions made with alco-
hol) of blue flag (Iris versicolor) or myrrh (Com-
miphora molmol), and slippery elm (Ulmus fulva)
made into a poultice.
Prognosis
The prognosis for most boils is excellent. Some
patients, however, suffer from recurrent carbuncles or
furunculosis. In addition, although the spread of infec-
tion from boils is relatively unusual, there have been
deaths reported from brain infections caused by squeez-
ing boils on the upper lip or in the tissue folds at the
base of the nose.
Prevention
There are some precautions that people can take to
minimize the risk of developing bacterial skin infections:
• cleanse skin properly with soap and water, and take
showers rather than tub baths
• do not share washcloths, towels, or facial cosmetics
with others
• cut down on greasy or fatty foods and snacks
• always wash hands before touching the face
• consider using antiseptic soaps and shower gels
• consult a doctor if furunculosis is a persistent prob-
lem—it may indicate an underlying disease such as
diabetes

Bone biopsy
Definition
Bone biopsy is the removal of a piece of bone for
laboratory examination and analysis.
Purpose
Bone biopsy is used to distinguish between malig-
nant tumors and benign bone disease such as osteoporo-
sisand osteomyelitis. This test may be ordered to deter-
mine why a patient’s bones ache or feel sore, or when a
mass or deformity is found on an x ray, CT scan, bone
scan, or other diagnostic imaging procedure.
Precautions
The patient’s doctor and the surgeon who performs
the bone biopsy must be told about any prescription and
over-the-counter medications the patient is taking, and
about allergiesor reactions the patient has had to anes-
thetics or painrelievers. Special care must be taken with
patients who have experienced bleeding problems.
Description
A bone biopsy involves using a special drill or other
surgical instruments to remove bone from the patient’s
body. The procedure usually lasts about 30 minutes and
may be performed in the hospital, a doctor’s office, or a
surgical center.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2538
Bone biopsy
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 538  A drill biopsy is generally used to obtain a small
specimen. After the skin covering the bone has been
cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient is
given a local anesthetic. The doctor will not begin the
procedure until the anesthetic has numbed the area from
which the bone is to be removed, but the patient may feel
pressure or mild pain when the needle pierces the bone.
The surgeon turns the needle in a half-circle to extract a
sample from the core, or innermost part, of the bone. The
sample is drawn into the hollow stem of the biopsy nee-
dle. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it is
examined under a microscope.
An open biopsy is used when a larger specimen is
needed. After the area covering the bone has been
cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient is
given a general anesthetic. After the anesthetic takes
effect and the patient is unconscious, the surgeon makes
an incision and removes a bone specimen. The specimen
is sent to the laboratory for immediate analysis. Results
of that analysis may indicate that additional surgery
should be performed right away.
Preparation
No special preparation is needed for a drill biopsy,
but a patient must fast for at least 12 hours before an
open biopsy.
Aftercare
Pain medication will be prescribed after a biopsy,
and vital signs will be monitored until they return to nor-
mal. Most patients can go home in about an hour. If bone
was removed from the spine, the patient may stay in the
hospital overnight. The surgical site must be kept clean
and dry for 48 hours, and the patient’s doctor should be
notified if any of these symptoms appear:
•fever
• headache
• pain on movement
• inflammation or pus near the biopsy site
• bleeding through the bandage at the biopsy site
Risks
Risks include bone fracture, injury to nearby tissue,
and infection. Bleeding is a rare complication. Factors
that increase risk include:
• stress
• obesity
• poor nutrition
KEY TERMS
Biopsy—Removal and examination of tissue to
determine if cancer is present.
Osteomyelitis—An infection of the bone that is
usually treated with antibiotics but sometimes
requires surgery.
Osteoporosis—Thinning and loss of bone tissue.
• chronic illness
• some medications
• mind-altering drugs
Normal results
Normal bone is made up of collagen fibers and bone
tissue.
Abnormal results
Bone biopsy can reveal the presence of benign dis-
ease, infection, or malignant tumors that have spread to
the bone from other parts of the body.
Results of this test are considered reliable, but may
be affected by:
• failure to fast before open biopsy
• failure to obtain an adequate specimen
• delayed microscopic examination or laboratory analysis

Bone density test
Definition
A bone density test, or scan, is designed to check for
osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when the bones
become thin and weak. Osteoporosis happens when the
bones lose calcium and other mineralsthat keep them
strong. Osteoporosis begins after menopausein many
women, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in seri-
ous fractures. These fractures may not only bring dis-
ability, but may affect longevity. As many as one-fourth
of women who fracture their hip after age 50 die within
one year.
Most people today will get a bone density scan from
a machine using a technology called Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry or DEXA for short. This machine takes a
picture of the bones in the spine, hip, total body and
wrist, and calculates their density. If a DEXA machine is
not available, bone density scans can also be done with
dual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hip
and total body) and quantitative computed tomography
scans(measuring the spine). Bone density scanners that
use DEXA technology to just measure bone density in
the wrist (called pDEXA scans) provide scans at some
drugstores. Yet these tests are not as accurate as those
that measure density in the total body, spine or hip—
where most fractures occur.
Purpose
A bone density scan measures the strength of an
individual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture. An
observation of any osteoporosis present can be made.
Description
To take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient lies on
a bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic arm that
emits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a fan beam that
rotates around the patient. During the test, the scanner
moves to capture images of the patient’s spine, hip or entire
body. A computer then compares the patient’s bone
strength and risk of fracture to that of other people in the
United States at the same age and to young people at peak
bone density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and then
start to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to do and
is painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about $250. Some
insurance companies and Medicare cover the cost. pDEXA
wrist bone scans in drugstores are available for about $30.
Preparation
The patient puts on a hospital gown and lies on the
bed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors routinely
schedule this test. If the following factors apply to a
patient, they may need a bone density scan and can dis-
cuss this with their doctor. The patient:
• is at risk for osteoporosis
• is near menopause
• has broken a bone after a modest trauma
• has a family history of osteoporosis
• uses steroid or antiseizure medications

months
Risks
The DEXA bone scan exposes the patient to only a
small amount of radiation—about one-fiftieth that of a
chest x ray, or about the amount you get from taking a
cross-country airplane flight.
Normal results
The patient, when compared with people at “young
normal bone density” (called the T-score) has the same or
denser bones than a healthy 30-year-old. T scores above
1 mean that a patient has a healthy bone mass. Scores
from 0 to 1 mean that the patient has borderline bone
mass and should repeat the test in two to five years.
Abnormal results
The patient has two to four times the risk of a broken
bone as other people in the United States at the same age
and those at peak bone density. If a patient’s T score

Bone disorder drugs

Bone disorder drugs are medicines used to treat dis-
eases that weaken the bones.

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 541  Purpose
The drugs described here are used to treat or prevent
osteoporosis(brittle bone disease) in women past
menopauseas well as older men. They also are used pre-
scribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that weak-
ens and deforms bones, and they are used to control calci-
um levels in the blood.
Bone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is con-
stantly being broken down and replaced with new materi-
al. Normally, there is a balance between the breakdown
of old bone and its replacement with new bone. But
when something goes wrong with the process, bone dis-
orders may result.
Osteoporosis is a particular concern for women
after menopause, as well as for older men. In osteo-
porosis, the inside of the bones become porous and thin.
Over time, this condition weakens the bones and makes
them more likely to break. Osteoporosis is four times
more common in women than in men. This is because
women have less bone mass than men, tend to live
longer and take in less calcium, and need the female
hormone estrogen to keep their bones strong. If men
live long enough, they are also at risk of getting osteo-
porosis later in life. Once total bone mass has peaked—
around age 35—all adults start to lose it. In women, the
rate of bone loss speeds up during menopause, when
estrogen levels fall. Bone loss may also occur if both
ovaries are removed by surgery. Ovaries make estrogen.
Hormone replacement therapyis one approach to
preventing osteoporosis. However, not all people can
use hormone replacement therapy. Bone disorder drugs
are a good alternative for people who already have
osteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it. Risk
factors include lack of regular exercise, early
menopause, being underweight, and a strong family
history of osteoporosis.
Description
Bone disorder drugs are available only with a
physician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasal
spray, and injectable forms. Commonly used bone dis-
order drugs are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin
(Miacalcin, Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Ralox-
ifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selective
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act like
estrogen in some parts of the body but not in others.
This makes the drugs less likely to cause some of the
harmful effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estro-
gen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast
cancer. In fact, research suggests that raloxifene may
even reduce that risk.
Recommended dosage
Alendronate
FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.The usual dose is 10 mg once
a day. Treatment usually continues over many years.
FOR PAGET’S DISEASE.The usual dose is 40 mg once
a day for six months.
This medicine works only when it is taken with a full
glass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30 min-
utes before eating or drinking anything or taking any
other medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes
after taking it because the drug can irritate the esophagus,
the tube that delivers food form the mouth to the stomach.
Calcitonin
NASAL SPRAY.The usual dose is one spray into the
nose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the right
nostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.
INJECTABLE.The recommended dosage depends on
the condition for which the medicine is prescribed and
may be different for different people. Check with the
physician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacist
who filled the prescription for the proper dosage.
Raloxifene
The usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.
Precautions
Aldendronate
People with low levels of calcium in their blood
should not take this medicine. It also is not recommended
for women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyone
with kidney problems. Before using alendronate, anyone
who has digestive or swallowing problems should make
sure that his or her physician knows about the condition.
Calcitonin
Calcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or small
sores in the nose. Check with a physician if this becomes
very uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose.
The injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious
allergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray is not
known to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists.
Before starting treatment with calcitonin, the physician
who prescribes the drug may order an allergy test to
make sure there will not be a problem.
Raloxifene
A rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is an
increased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2542
Bone disorder drugs
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 542  may break away and travel to the lungs. This is about as
likely in women who take raloxifene as it is in women
who take estrogen. Because of this possible problem,
women with a history of blood clots in their veins should
not take raloxifene.
Women who have had breast canceror cancer of the
uterus should check with their physicians about whether
they can safely use raloxifene.
General precautions for bone disorder drugs
To keep bones strong, the body needs calcium and
vitamin D. Dairy products and fish such as salmon, sar-
dines and tuna are good sources of both calcium and vita-
min D. People who are taking bone disorder drugs for
osteoporosis and who do not get enough of these nutri-
ents in their dietsshould check with their physicians
about taking supplements. Other important bone-saving
steps are avoiding smokingand alcohol and getting
enough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on the
bones (such as walking or lifting weights).
People who are taking these drugs because they have
too much calcium in their blood may need to limitthe
amount of calcium in their diets. Too much calcium may pre-
vent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the proper
diet with the physician who prescribed the drug, and do not
make any diet changes without the physician’s approval.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis-
order drugs in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician also
should be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preser-
vatives, or other substances.
Women who are pregnant or who may become preg-
nant and women who are breastfeeding should check
with their physicians before using this alendronate or cal-
citonin. Raloxifene should not be used by women who
are pregnant or who may become pregnant. In laboratory
studies of rats, raloxifene caused birth defects.
Side effects
Aldendronate
Common side effects include constipation,diar-
rhea,indigestion, nausea,painin the abdomen, and
pain in the muscles and bones. These problems usually
go away as the body adjusts to the medicine and do not
need medical attention unless they continue or they inter-
fere with normal activities.

The most common side effects of calcitonin nasal
spray are nose problems, such as dryness, redness,itch-

such as nausea or vomiting; diarrhea; stomach pain; loss
of appetite; flushing of the face, ears, hands or feet; and
discomfort or redness at the place on the body where it is
injected. Medical attention is not necessary unless these
problems persist or cause unusual discomfort.
Anyone who has a skin rash or hivesafter taking
injectable calcitonin should check with a physician as
soon as possible.
Raloxifene
Common side effects include hot flashes, leg
cramps,nausea and vomiting. Women who have these
problems while taking raloxifene should check with their
physicians.
Interactions
Aldendronate
Taking aspirinwith alendronate may increase the
chance of upset stomach, especially if the dose of alen-
dronate is more than 10 mg per day. If an analgesic is

minophen(Tylenol) or use buffered aspirin. Ask a physi-
cian or pharmacist for the correct medication to use.
Some calcium supplements,antacidsand other
medicines keep the body from absorbing alendronate. To
prevent this problem, do not take any other medicine
within 30 minutes of taking alendronate.
Calcitonin
Calcitonin may keep certain other drugs for Paget’s
disease, such as etidronate (Didronel), from working as
they should.
Raloxifene
Raloxifene may affect blood clotting. Patients who
are taking other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as
warfarin (Coumadin), should check with their physicians
before using raloxifene.

Bone grafting
Definition
Bone grafting is a surgical procedure by which new
bone or a replacement material is placed into spaces
between or around broken bone (fractures) or holes in
bone (defects) to aid in healing.
Purpose
Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that
are extremely complex, pose a significant risk to the
patient, or fail to heal properly. Bone graft is also used to
help fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, or
provide structural support for fractures of the spine. In
addition to fracture repair, bone graft is used to repair
defects in bone caused by birth defects, traumatic injury,
or surgery for bone cancer.
Description
Bone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up of a
protein called collagen. It is strengthened by deposits of
calcium and phosphate salts, called hydroxyapatite.
Within and around this matrix are located the cells of the
bones, which are of four types. Osteoblasts produce the
bone matrix. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serve
to maintain the bone. Osteoclasts break down and
remove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone sur-
faces. Together, these four types of cells are responsible
for building the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remod-
eling the bone as needed.
There are three ways in which a bone graft can help
repair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the for-
mation of new bone by the cells contained within the
graft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical process
in which molecules contained within the graft (bone
morphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s cells into
cells that are capable of forming bone. The third is osteo-
conduction, a physical effect by which the matrix of the
graft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient are
able to form new bone.
New bone for grafting can be obtained from other
bones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or ribs),
called autograft, or from bone taken from other people
that is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft.
A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materials
are also used instead of bone, including collagen (the
protein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone,
and connective tissues); polymers, such as silicone and
some acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; and
ceramics. A new material, called resorbable polymeric
grafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts pro-
vide a structure for new bone to grow on; the grafts then
slowly dissolve, leaving only the new bone behind.
To place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision in
the skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft or
replacement material to fit into the defect. After the graft
is placed into the defect, it is held in place with pins,
plates, or screws. The incision is closed with stitches and
a splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the bones
while healing.
The costs associated with a bone graft vary. These
costs include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiolo-
gist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospital
charges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more for
intensive care or private rooms); medication charges
($200 to $400); and additional charges, including an
assisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diagnostic
procedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical sup-
plies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft itself can
range from $250 to $900.

Bone grafting
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 544  This procedure is covered by many third-party insur-
ers; insurance coverage should be explored for each indi-
vidual case.
Aftercare
The time required for convalescence for fractures or
spinal fusion may vary from one to 10 days, and vigor-
ous exercisemay be limited for up to three months.
Most bone grafts are successful in helping the bone
defect to heal. The extent of recovery will depend on the
size of the defect and the condition of the bone sur-
rounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe defects
may take some time to heal and may require further
attention after the initial graft. In one study of over
1,000 patients who received very large allografts after
surgery for bone cancer, researchers found that approxi-
mately 85% of the patients were able to return to work
or normal physical activities without using crutches.
However, about 25% of these patients required a second
operation, because the first did not heal properly. Less
severe bone defects, though, should heal completely
without serious complications.
Risks
The risks for any surgical procedure requiring anes-
thesia include reactions to the medications and breathing
problems. The risks for any surgical procedure include
bleeding and infection.
The drawbacks of autografts include: the additional
surgical and anesthesia time (typically 30 minutes per
procedure) to obtain, or harvest, the bone for grafting;
added costs of the additional surgery; painand infection
that might occur at the site from which the graft is taken;
and the relatively small amount of bone that is available
for grafting.
The drawbacks of allografts include: variability
between lots, since the bone is harvested from a variety
of donors; the bone may take longer to incorporate with
the host bone than an autograft would; the graft may be
less effective than an autograft; and the possibility of
transferring diseases to the patient. Other complications
may result from the immune response mounted by the
patient’s immune system against the grafted bone tissue.
With the use anti-rejection agents (drugs to combat
rejection of grafted bone tissue) immune rejection is less
of a problem.

Bone growth stimulation
Definition
Bone growth stimulation is the technique of promot-
ing bone growth in difficult to heal fracturesby apply-
ing a low electrical current or ultrasound to the fracture.
Purpose
Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactory
healing is not occurring naturally or when the pace of
healing is too slow. This condition is called fracture
nonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adults
than children, in people with severe or complex fractures,
and in people who smoke.
The theory behind applying an electric current to
fractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that
the concave side of the bone becomes negatively
charged and the convex side is positively charged. It is
believed that artificially encouraging this charging with
an electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved the
application of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treat-
ment for fracture nonunion.
Ultrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are
expensive and are used only when healing problems exist
for a substantial length of time. Each method must be
used for at least three to six months to be effective.
Precautions
Bone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap
between the ends of the fracture is too large.
Description
Electric stimulation can be applied either from the
inside of the body (invasively) or from the outside the
body (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive pro-
cedure. The type of stimulation selected depends on the
doctor’s preference, the type and location of the fracture,
and the patient’s motivation to comply with the treat-
ment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere from three
to six months.
Invasive stimulators
Invasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial-
ly implantable. The advantage of these devices is that they
apply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours a
day. The fully implantable stimulator requires little daily
attention from the patient. Patients using a semi-implanted
stimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule and
have to care for the external power pack. The disadvantage
of implantable and semi-implantable stimulators is that
their implantation is a surgical procedure.
Fully implantable direct current stimulators are
installed in a hospital under general or regional anesthesia.
Both the stimulator and the power source are implanted.
The surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shaped
cathode inside the bone. A wire leads to the power source
and a small anode. The power source is a battery pack that
is implanted in the nearby muscle. The body transmits
electrical current to close the circuit. The incision is then
closed. Once in place, the device provides continuous
direct electric current for bone growth stimulation.
Partially implanted stimulators use cathode pins that
are implanted at the edge of each bone that is fractured.
Wires lead to the surface of the skin where a power
source and the anode are located. Wires complete the cir-
cuit. The external portion of the device is held in place by
a cast. This source of stimulation also runs continuously.
Noninvasive stimulators
In the noninvasive stimulator, external electromag-
netic coils are placed on either side of the fracture and
are held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the coils
correctly is important, and their location relative to the
fracture is usually confirmed by x rays.
The coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field.
It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatment
schedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation any-
where from three to ten hours each day in periods of no
less than one hour.
Ultrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment
for stimulating bone growth. A device that generates low
intensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over the
fracture. The advantage of this technique is that it is non-
invasive and the period of application of the sound pulses
can be as short as 20-30 minutes each day. The results of
this treatment have been studied less than the effect of
electromagnetic stimulation.
Preparation
Bone growth stimulation is done only when healing
has failed to occur for many months. Before it is started,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2546
Bone growth stimulation
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 546  x rays are done of the fracture area. If the device is to be
implanted, standard preoperative blood and urine tests
are done. The patient may meet with an anesthesiologist
to discuss any conditions that might affect the adminis-
tration of anesthesia.
Aftercare
If a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field
device is used, the patient must not put any stressor
weight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a matter
of months in most cases. In all lower limb fractures,
regardless of the stimulation method used, the patient can
not bear weight on the limb with the fracture until heal-
ing is complete. This limits the patient’s mobility for
many months. Patients have the responsibility for regu-
larly making sure that the unit works and caring for
external devices and the casts that hold them in place.
Risks
Noninvasive devices have few risks associated with
them. The main risk associated with implantable devices
is the development of infection at the site of implantation.
Normal results
Success in healing a fracture nonunion using bone
growth stimulation depends on the type, location, and
severity of the fracture and the age and general health of
the patient.

Bone marrow aspiration 
and biopsy
Definition
Bone marrow aspiration, also called bone marrow
sampling, is the removal by suction of fluid from the
soft, spongy material that lines the inside of most bones.
Bone marrow biopsy, or needle biopsy, is the removal of
a small piece of bone marrow.
KEY TERMS
Anode—The positive electrode to which an elec-
tromagnetic current flows.
Cathode—The negative electrode from which an
electromagnetic current flows.
Purpose
Bone marrow aspiration is used to:
• pinpoint the cause of abnormal blood test results
• confirm a diagnosis or check the status of severe ane-
mia (abnormally low numbers of red blood cells in the
bloodstream) of unknown cause, or other irregularities
in the way blood cells are produced or become mature
• evaluate abnormalities in the blood’s ability to store
iron
• diagnose infection
Bone marrow biopsy is used to:
• obtain intact bone marrow for laboratory analysis
• diagnose and stage some types of canceror anemia and
other blood disorders
• identify the source of an unexplained fever
• diagnose fibrosis of bone marrow or myeloma (a tumor
composed of cells normally found in the bone marrow)
when bone marrow aspiration has failed to provide an
appropriate specimen
Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy
are also used to gauge the effectiveness of chemothera-
pyand other medical treatments. These procedures are
often used together to ensure the availability of the best
possible bone marrow specimen.
Precautions
Allergiesor previous adverse reactions to medica-
tions should be discussed with the doctor. Any current
medications, including herbal or nutritional supplements,
should be evaluated for the potential to interfere with
proper coagulation (clot formation). These would include
coumadin,aspirin, and other agents used as blood thin-
ners. Caution should be used when the herbs gingko, gin-
ger, garlic, or ginseng have been utilized as supplements,
due to a risk of bleeding.
Pregnancy,lactation(production and secretion of
milk), and preexisting platelet or bleeding disorders
should be evaluated before either procedure is undertaken.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	547
Bone marrow aspiration 
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 547  Description
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be per-
formed by a physician or nurse clinician. Each proce-
dure takes about 20 to 30 minutes and is usually per-
formed on an outpatient basis, but can be done in a hos-
pital if necessary.
The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with an
antiseptic, and the patient may be given a mild sedative.
A local anesthetic is administered. The hematologist or
nurse clinician performing the procedure will not begin
until the anesthetic has numbed the area from which the
specimen is to be extracted. In both adults and children,
aspiration and biopsy are most commonly performed on
the rear bone of the hip (posterior iliac crest). In adults,
sampling from the sternum (breastbone) is sometimes
done. The latter location is technically easier, but is
somewhat more painful for the patient and presents the
risk of heart injury. On rare occasions, a long bone of the
leg (tibia) may be used as a sample site for an infant.
In a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle is
inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetrates
the cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At least half a
teaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from the bone by a
syringe attached to the needle. The patient may experi-
ence discomfort when the needle is inserted or when the
marrow is aspirated. If more marrow is needed, the nee-
dle is repositioned slightly, a new syringe is attached, and
a second sample is taken. The samples are transferred
from the syringes to slides and vials, then sent to a labo-
ratory for analysis.
Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immediately
before or after bone marrow aspiration. The procedure uti-
lizes a special large-bore needle that is used to drill out a
core of marrow. In bone marrow biopsy, the needle is
inserted, rotated from side to side, withdrawn, and reinsert-
ed at a different angle. This procedure is repeated if needed
until a small core, about 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separat-
ed from the bone marrow. The needle is again removed,
and a piece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfers
the specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel dis-
comfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and experi-
ence a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow is with-
drawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are smeared,
these samples contain structurally intact bone marrow.
Microscopic examination can show what material its cells

er. The bone may either be embedded intact in paraffin (a
type of wax), or be decalcified (a process which takes place
overnight) for a different type of staining and examination.
Each type of preparation has certain advantages.
Preparation
A current history and physical are obtained from the
patient, along with proper consent. The patient is gener-
ally placed in a prone position (lying face down) for
preparation, and local anesthetic, with or without seda-
tion, is administered.
Aftercare
After the needle is removed, the biopsy site will be
covered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied to
control bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing, blood
pressure, and temperature are monitored until they return
to normal, and the patient may be instructed to remain in
a supine position (lying face up) for half an hour before
getting dressed.
The patient should be able to leave the clinic and
resume normal activities immediately. Patients who have
received a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest of the day;
driving, cooking, and other activities that require clear
thinking and quick reactions should therefore be avoided.
The biopsy site should be kept covered and dry for
several hours. Walking or taking prescribed painmedica-
tions usually ease any discomfort felt at the biopsy site,
and ice can be used to reduce swelling.
A doctor should be notified if the patient:
• feels severe pain more than 24 hours after the procedure.
• experiences persistent bleeding or notices more than a
few drops of blood on the wound dressing.
• has a temperature above 101°F (38.3°C). Inflammation
and pus at the biopsy site and other signs of infection
should also be reported to a doctor without delay
Risks
Bleeding and discomfort often occur at the biopsy
site. Infection and hematoma may also develop. In rare
instances, the heart or a major blood vessel is pierced
when marrow is extracted from the sternum during bone
marrow biopsy. This can lead to severe hemorrhage.
Normal results
Healthy adult bone marrow contains yellow fat cells,
connective tissue, and red marrow that produces blood.
KEY TERMS
Aspiration—A procedure to withdraw fluid from
the body.
Connective tissue—Material that links one part of
the body with another.
Fibrosis—A condition characterized by the pres-
ence of scar tissue or fiber-containing tissues that
replace normal tissues.
Hematologist—A medical specialist who treats
diseases and disorders of the blood and blood-
forming organs.
Hematoma—Blood that collects under the skin
and causes swelling.
Hemorrhage—Heavy bleeding.
Myeloma—A tumor that originates in bone mar-
row and usually spreads to more than one bone.
Nurse practitioner—A registered nurse who is
qualified to perform some specialized duties.
The bone marrow of a healthy infant is primarily red due
to active production of red cells necessary for growth.
Abnormal results
Culture of bone marrow aspirate may yield informa-
tion about an infectious agent. Microscopic examination
of bone marrow can reveal granulomas,myelofibrosis,
lymphomas, leukemias, or other cancers. Analyzing spec-
imens can help doctors diagnose iron deficiency, vitamin
B
12deficiency, and folate deficiency, as well as anemia.
Obesitycan affect the ease with which a bone mar-
row biopsy can be done, and the results of either proce-
dure can be affected if the patient has had radiation
therapyat the biopsy site.

Bone marrow transplantation
Definition
The bone marrow—the sponge-like tissue found in
the center of certain bones—contains stem cells that are
the precursors of white blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets. These blood cells are vital for normal body
functions, such as oxygen transport, defense against
infection and disease, and clotting. Blood cells have a
limited lifespan and are constantly being replaced; there-
fore, healthy stem cells are vital.
In association with certain diseases, stem cells may
produce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal blood
cells. Also, medical treatments may destroy stem cells or
alter blood cell production. The resultant blood cell
abnormalities can be life threatening.
Bone marrow transplantation involves extracting
bone marrow containing normal stem cells from a
healthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient whose
body cannot manufacture proper quantities of normal
blood cells. The goal of the transplant is to rebuild the
recipient’s blood cells and immune system and hopefully
cure the underlying ailment.
Purpose
A person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due to
disease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularly
chemotherapyor radiation treatment, may destroy a
person’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s health
is severe. Under normal circumstances, red blood cells
carry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbon
dioxide from the body’s tissues. White blood cells form
the cornerstone of the body’s immune system and defend
it against infection. Platelets limit bleeding by enabling	the blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged.
A bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the
body’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bring
their numbers to normal levels. Illnesses that may be
treated with a bone marrow transplant include both can-
cerous and noncancerous diseases.
Cancerous diseases may or may not specifically
involve blood cells; but,cancertreatment can destroy the
body’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone mar-
row transplantation may be used in conjunction with
additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for various
types of leukemia,Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, breast
and ovarian cancer, and other cancers. Noncancerous
diseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be a
treatment option include aplastic anemia,sickle cell
disease,thalassemia, and severe immunodeficiency.
Precautions
Bone marrow transplants are not for everyone.
Transplants are accompanied by a risk of infection, trans-
plant rejection by the recipient’s immune system, and
other complications. The procedure has a lower success
rate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications are
exacerbated for people whose health is already seriously
impaired as in late-stage cancers. Therefore, a person’s
age or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrow
transplant. The typical cut-off age for a transplant ranges
from 40 to 55 years; however, a person’s general health is
usually the more important factor.
Even in the absence of complications, the transplant
and associated treatments are hard on the recipient. Bone
marrow transplants are debilitating. A person’s ability to
withstand the rigors of the transplant is a key considera-
tion in deciding to use this treatment.
Description
Autologous and allogeneic transplants
Two important requirements for a bone marrow
transplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,
the donor and the recipient may be the same person. This
type of transplant is called an autologous transplant. It is
typically used in cases in which a person’s bone marrow
is generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medical
treatment for diseases such as breast cancerand
Hodgkin’s disease. Most bone marrow transplants are
autologous. If a person’s bone marrow is unsuitable for
an autologous transplant, the bone marrow must be
derived from another person in an allogeneic transplant.
Allogeneic transplants are more complicated
because of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2550
Bone marrow transplantation
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 550  (HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. If
the donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens,
the recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bone
marrow cells as invaders and launches a destructive
attack against them. Such an attack negates any benefits
offered by the transplant.
HLA matching
There are only five major HLA classes or types—
designated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but much
variation within the groupings. For example, HLA–A
from one individual may be similar to, but not the same
as, HLA–A in another individual; such a situation can
render a transplant from one to the other impossible.
HLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip-
ient are related, particularly if they are siblings; however,
an unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only in
rare cases is matching HLA types between two people
not an issue: if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi-
cal twins carry the same genes; therefore, the same anti-
gens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twins
is called a syngeneic transplant.
Peripheral blood stem cell transplants
A relatively recent development in stem cell trans-
plantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead of
stem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells
(PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather than
from bone marrow, but the amount of stem cells found in
the peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount of
stem cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood
stem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneic
transplants. The majority of PBSC transplants are autolo-
gous. However, recent clinical studies indicate that
PBSCs are being used more frequently than bone mar-
row for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
The advantages of PBSC transplants when compared
to bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic transplanta-
tion, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster with
PBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recur-
rence, primarily graft-versus-host-disease. In autologous
transplantation, the use of PBSCs can result in faster
blood countrecoveries. Also, some medical conditions
exist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrow
stem cell transplants, but can accept PBSC transplants.
Some possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versus
bone marrow transplantation are: so much more fluid vol-
ume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at the
time of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, the
fluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidney
problems. Also, the time commitment for the donor for a
PBSC transplant is considerable. When the PBSCs are
being collected, several outpatient sessions are needed
and each session lasts approximately two–four hours.
The transplant procedure
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone mar-
row extraction, or harvest, is the same whether for an autol-
ogous or allogeneic transplant. Harvesting is done under
general anesthesia (i.e., the donor sleeps through the proce-
dure), and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards. Bone
marrow is drawn from the iliac crest (the part of the hip
bone to either side of the lower back) with a special needle
and a syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary to
collect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately
1–2 quarts (0.9-1.91). (This amount is only a small percent-
age of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced with-
in four weeks.) The donor remains at the hospital for 24–48
hours and can resume normal activities within a few days.
If the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans-
plant, it is stored at –112 to –320°F (–80 to –196°C) until
it is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant is
sometimes treated to remove the donor’s T cells (a type
of white blood cell) or to remove ABO (blood type) anti-
gens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification.

Bone marrow transplantation
In autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are
collected from the patient. Once the patient has undergone
chemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the blood via an intra-
venous catheter. The cells return to the bone marrow and
begin producing healthy new cells.(Illustration by Argosy Inc.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 551  The bone marrow is administered to the recipient via
a catheter (a narrow, flexible tube) inserted into a large
vein in the chest. From the bloodstream, it migrates to
the cavities within the bones where bone marrow is nor-
mally stored. If the transplant is successful, the bone
marrow begins to produce normal blood cells once it is in
place, or engrafted.
PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION.
Before collection for a PBSC transplant, donors receive
daily four injections of the drug G-CSF, or filgrastim.

mal cells are destroyed. Conditioning rids the body of dis-
eased cells and makes room for the marrow to be transplant-
ed. It typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation treat-
ment, depending on the disease being treated. Unfortunately,
this treatment also destroys healthy cells and has many side
effects such as extreme weakness, nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea. These side effects may continue for several weeks.
Aftercare
A two– to four–week waiting period follows the mar-
row transplant before its success can begin to be judged.
The marrow recipient is kept in isolationduring this time
to minimize potential infections. The recipient also
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	553
Bone marrow transplantation
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 553  receives antibiotic medications and blood and platelet
transfusions to help fight off infection and prevent exces-
sive bleeding. Further side effects, such as nausea and
vomiting, can be treated with other medications. Once
blood counts are normal and the side effects of the trans-
plant abate, the recipient is taken off antibioticsand usu-
ally no longer needs blood and platelet transfusions.
Following discharge from the hospital, the recipient is
monitored through home visits by nurses or out-patient vis-
its for up to a year. For the first several months out of the
hospital, the recipient needs to be careful in avoiding
potential infections. For example, contact with other people
who may be ill should be avoided or kept to a minimum.
Further blood transfusions and medications may be neces-
sary, but barring complications, the recipient can return to
normal activities about 6–8 months after the transplant.
Risks
Bone marrow transplants are accompanied by seri-
ous and life-threatening risks. Furthermore, they are not
always an absolute assurance of a cure for the underlying
ailment; a disease may recur in the future. Approximate-
ly 30% of people receiving allogeneic transplants do not
survive. Autologous transplants have a much better sur-
vival rate—nearly 90%—but are not appropriate for all
types of ailments requiring a bone marrow transplant.
Furthermore, they have a higher failure rate with certain
diseases, specifically leukemia.
In the short term, there is the danger of pneumonia
or other infectious disease, excessive bleeding, or liver
disorder caused by blocked blood vessels. The transplant
may be rejected by the recipient’s immune system, or the
donor bone marrow may launch an immune-mediated
attack against the recipient’s tissues. This complication is
called acute graft versus host disease, and it can be a life-
threatening condition. Characteristic signs of the disease
include fever, rash, diarrhea, liver problems, and a com-
promised immune system.
Approximately 25–50% of bone marrow transplant
recipients develop long-term complications. Chronic graft
versus host disease symptoms include skin changes such as
dryness, altered pigmentation, and thickening; abnormal
liver function tests; dry mouthand eyes; infections; and
weight loss. Other long-term complications include
cataracts(due to radiation treatment), abnormal lung func-
tion, hormonal abnormalities resulting in reduced growth
or hypothyroidism, secondary cancers, and infertility.
Normal results
In a successful bone marrow transplant, the donor’s
marrow migrates to the cavities in the recipient’s bones
and produces normal numbers of healthy blood cells.
Bone marrow transplants can extend a person’s life,
improve quality of life, and may aid in curing the under-
lying ailment.

Bone nuclear medicine scan
Definition
A bone scan is a diagnostic procedure used to evalu-
ate abnormalities involving bones and joints. A radioac-
tive substance is injected intravenously, and the image of
its distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detect
certain diseases or conditions.
Purpose
Bone scans are most frequently ordered to check
whether a cancerthat originated elsewhere has spread to
the bones. Cancers which begin in the breasts, kidneys,
lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder are most like-
ly to spread, or metastasize, to the bones. If metastases
are found, periodic bone scans may be ordered to see if
therapy is effective against a cancer.
Some cancers arise in bone. These are called primary
bone cancers. When an abnormality is found on an x ray of
a bone, a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a pri-
mary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition.
Infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) can be detected
or confirmed by a bone scan, often days or weeks before
an x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are useful in diag-
nosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both the
progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treat-
ment. Unexplained painmay be evaluated with a bone
scan, because it can demonstrate fractureswhich are dif-
ficult to detect on x ray. Bone scans can be used to see if
artificial joints have loosened or become infected. Sus-
pected child abusemay be evaluated with a bone scan,
due to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeated
trauma. Abnormalities caused by altered circulation to
the bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan.
Precautions
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should
not have this test. A patient who is unable to remain still
for an extended period of time may require sedationfor
a bone scan.
Description
This test is performed in a radiology facility, either
in a hospital department or an outpatient x-ray center.
The patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactive
substance is injected through a vein in the arm. For a
bone scan, the radionuclide used is specifically chosen to
accumulate in the bone. The patient then waits from three
to four hours, for the substance to collect within the
skeletal system. During this time, he or she will be
instructed to drink several glasses of water. Patients are
free to get up and move around as they desire during this
waiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just before
the scanning begins, the patient should empty his or her
bladder again. This ensures that a lot of radioactive mate-
rial is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, which
could obscure part of the pelvic bones.
During the scan, the patient lies on his or her back
on a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or side
during the study. It is important for the patient not to
move, except when directed to by the technologist.
The radionuclide scanner, sometimes called a
gamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positioned
against the body part to be examined. Either the camera,
the table, or both, may change position during the study.
For a total body bone scan, the patient is scanned from
head to foot, over a period of 30-60 minutes. Patients
should experience no discomfort from this examination.
A special kind of bone scan, called a SPECT (Single
Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan may be
added, to study a particular part of the body in more
detail. Suspected diseases of the hips, lower back, or jaw
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	555
Bone nuclear medicine scan
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 555  are often evaluated using this study. It usually takes an
additional 30-45 minutes. The camera circles completely
around the area in question or multiple cameras are used
to create a cross-sectional image. This helps pinpoint the
location of the abnormality being evaluated.
Another variation is called a three-phase, or three-
stage, bone scan. The procedure is the same, except the
scanning takes place immediately after the radioactive
substance is injected, approximately 20 minutes after the
injection, then two to four hours later.
Preparation
Some specialized blood studies should be drawn
before this study is begun. Jewelry or metallic objects
need to be removed. No other special physical prepara-
tion is required.
The patient should understand that there is no dan-
ger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others, as
only small amounts of the radioisotope are used. The
total dose of radiation absorbed is minimal, often less
than the amount received from ordinary x rays. The
radionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all,
but detects and records it from the patient.
Aftercare
Fluids are encouraged after the scan to aid in the
excretion of the radioisotope. It is almost completely
eliminated from the body within 24 hours.
Normal results
The normal appearance of the scan will vary accord-
ing to the patient’s age. In general, a uniform concentra-
tion of radionuclide uptake is present in all bones in a
normal scan.
Abnormal results
A high concentration of radionuclide occurs in areas
of increased bone activity. These regions appear brighter
and may be referred to as “hot spots”. They may indicate

ting form, of an element.

healing fractures, tumors, infections, or other processes
which trigger new bone formation. Lower concentrations
of radionuclide may be called “cold spots”. Poor blood
flow to an area of bone, or bone destruction from tumor
may produce a cold spot.
The bone scan is a very sensitive test and can detect
subtle conditions more readily than other studies. How-
ever, it is not a very specific examination, and often can-
not distinguish exactly what disease process is causing
an abnormality. Results need to be correlated with the
patient’s medical history, and other radiologic and labo-
ratory studies to make a definite diagnosis.

Bone x rays
Definition
Bone x rays are a diagnostic test in which ionizing
radiation passing through the bones being examined
enables an image to be produced on film.
Purpose
Bone x rays are ordered to detect disease or injury to
the bone such as broken bones, tumors, and other prob-
lems. They can determine bone density, texture, erosion,
and changes in bone relationships. Bone x rays also eval-
uate the joints for diseases such as osteoarthritis.
Precautions
Precautions should be taken to protect patients from
unnecessary exposure to radiation. Patients should be
shielded with lead aprons as much as possible. Women of
childbearing age who could be pregnant should not have
x rays of their trunk or pelvic regions. The fetus is espe-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2556
Bone x rays
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 556  cially at risk during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Women who are pregnant should not have x rays of their
pelvic region, lumbar spine, and abdomen unless
absolutely necessary. If other types of x rays are neces-
sary, a lead apron should be used to shield the abdominal
and pelvic regions.
Description
X rays are a common diagnostic test in which a form
of energy called x-ray radiation penetrates the patient’s
body. In bone x rays, electrical current passes through an
x-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing radiation that
passes through the bone(s) being examined. This produces
a picture of the inside of the body on film. The physician
reads the developed x ray on a wall-mounted light box.
Digital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con-
ventional equipment is used to take the x ray but the
image is produced via computer. In a digital x ray, the
image is created on a reusable plate. After being read by
a laser reader, the information is sent in digital form to a
storage unit connected to a computer network from
which the radiologist reads the x ray. An electronic report
can then be sent to the patient’s physician.
Problems with bones that x rays can detect result
from injury or from disease caused by a malfunction in
the patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especially
broken bones (fractures), are common and can be
accurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are espe-
cially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete frac-
tures which can’t be detected during a physical exami-
nation. X rays can also be used to check for bone posi-
tion in a fracture. Some bone diseases can be definitive-
ly diagnosed with bone x rays while others require
additional tests.
Osteoporosis, a common bone disease, can be detect-
ed in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered to deter-
mine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rick-
ets, a blood test and x rays of the affected bone are usually
definitive; in some cases a bone biopsy(microscopic
analysis of a small ammount of tissue) is also done. In a
rare bone disease called Paget’s disease, x rays may be
used in conjunction with bone, blood, and urine tests to
make a diagnosis. In another rare bone disease, fibrous
dysplasia, bone x rays or a bone biopsy (microscopic
analysis of a small amount of tissue) are used to confirm
the diagnosis. Bone x rays are definitive in diagnosing
osteogenesis imperfecta. For osteomyelitis, bone x rays
are used in conjunction with a blood test, bone scan, or
needle biopsy to make the diagnosis. For arthritis, x rays
of the bone are occasionally used in conjunction with
blood tests. In bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful but
they may not be definitive.
Bone x rays are performed by a technician or radiol-
ogist, and interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken in
a physician’s office, radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or
diagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than 10
minutes. There is no painor discomfort associated with
the test, but some people find it difficult to remain still.
The results are often available in minutes.
During the test, the patient lies on a table. The tech-
nician taking the x ray will check the patient’s position-
ing and place the x-ray machine over the part of the body
being examined. After asking the patient to remain
motionless, he or she steps out of the area and presses a
button to take the picture.
Preparation
The patient is asked to remove clothing, jewelry, and
any other metal objects from the area being x rayed. If
appropriate, a lead shield will be placed over other body
parts to minimize exposure to radiation.
Aftercare
The patient can immediately resume normal activities.
Risks
The human body contains some natural radiation
and is also exposed to radiation in the environment.
There is a slight risk from exposure to radiation during
bone x rays, however, the amount of radiation is small
and the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organs
are exposed to radiation, genetic alterations may occur.
Excessive or repeated doses of radiation can cause
changes in other types of body tissue. No radiation
remains in the body after the x ray.
Normal results
Normal bones show no fractures, dislocations, or
other abnormalities.
Abnormal results
Results that indicate the presence of bone injury or
disease differ in appearance according to the nature of the
injury/disease. For example, fractures show up as clear
breaks in the bones, while osteoporotic bone has the same
shape as a normal bone on an x ray but is less dense.

Botulinum toxin injections
Definition
Botulinum is a bacterium (Clostridium botulinum) that
produces seven different toxins that can cause botulism
and is also medically used to block muscle contractions.
Purpose
Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection is used in condi-
tions of excessive and inappropriate muscle contraction,
hyperhidiosis (excess sweating) in armpits and palms,
spasticity (persistent states of muscle contraction), sphinc-
ter contraction, eye-movement disorders, tics and tremors,
and cosmetically to treat facial lines and wrinkles.
Botox has also been explored in the treatment of
chronic muscle tension and migraine headaches. The
relief is likely due to the decrease in localized muscle
spasms, as no direct effect of Botox on the sensory
nerves has been established.
Precautions
Botulinum toxin is produced from the bacterium that
causes food poisoningin humans. High doses of the
toxin can be fatal; however, doses administered therapeu-
tically are so small that harmful effects are uncommon.
Description
The number of potential applications for botulinum
toxin extends to every muscle group. The first therapeu-
tic use of Botox was in the treatment of strabismus(eyes
are unable to direct towards the same object) and since
then it has been used to treat a variety of involuntary
muscle contractions or disorders. Its cosmetic use is the
result of treatment for facial spasms where smoothing of
facial lines was reported by patients. In general, 90% of
injections for facial spasms are resolved satisfactorily.
Toxin type A has a duration of effect that lasts
approximately three months and is the therapeutic agent
of choice for most conditions.
Preparation
The dosage of Botox must be monitored and adjust-
ed, with multiple injections showing a lower incidence of
complications versus administration by one larger dose.
Risks
In over 30 years of therapeutic use in humans, botu-
linum toxin has proven to be remarkably safe. Difficul-

patients may experience different effects at the same
dose, patients new to the treatment may experience exag-
gerated effects at subsequent visits and/or neighboring
muscles may become activated at subsequent treatments.
Additional side effects may include excessive mus-
cle weakness at the injection site or adjacent muscles.
These effects typically resolve quickly. Occasionally,
patients report flu-like symptoms but they are usually
self-limited.
A certain percentage of patients may also experience
resistance to the toxin. The presence of circulating anti-
bodies to the toxin is presumed to be the primary reason
for resistance to Botox injections. Patients who have lit-
tle reaction to Botox ‘A’ may benefit from injections
using one of the other six serotypes. Using the smallest
effective dose limits the likelihood of immunoresistance
in unresponsive patients.
Normal results
The anticipated outcome of Botox injections is
relaxation of the target muscle tissue. The pharmacologi-
cal effects of botulinum toxin are typically isolated to
local areas and do not result in tissue destruction or pro-
longed paralysis. Varying the dose can deliver a precise
amount of toxin to achieve graded degrees of paralysis
for the desired level of response.

Botulism
Definition
Botulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a natural
poison produced by certain bacteria in the Clostridium
genus. Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostly
from eating contaminated food, or in infants, from cer-
tain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum toxin
blocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, the
neurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles, and
flaccid paralysisoccurs. As botulism progresses, the
muscles that control the airway and breathing fail.
Description
Botulism occurs rarely, but it incites concern
because of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions of
botulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancient
Rome and Greece. However, the relationship between
contaminated food and botulism wasn’t defined until the
late 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, Justinius
Kerner, deduced that a substance in spoiled sausages,
which he called wurstgift(German for sausage poison),
caused botulism. The toxin’s origin and identity
remained elusive until Emile von Ermengem, a Belgian
professor, isolated Clostridium botulinumin 1895 and
identified it as the poison source.
Three types of botulism have been identified: food-
borne, wound, and infant botulism. The main difference
between types hinges on the route of exposure to the
toxin. In the United States, there are approximately 110
cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne botu-
lism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and can be
traced to eating contaminated home-preserved food.
Infant botulism accounts for 72% of all cases, but the
recovery rate is good (about 98%) with proper treatment.
Though domestic food poisoningis a problem
world-wide, there has been a growing concern regarding
the use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror-

had loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into SCUD
missiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these special mis-
siles were never used. As of 1999, there were 17 coun-
tries known to be developing biological weapons, includ-
ing the culture of botulism toxins.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu-
linumis the main culprit in botulism. Other members of
the clostridiumgenus can produce botulinum toxin,
namely C. argentinense,C. butyricum, and C. baratii,but
they are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria require a
low-acid, oxygen-free environment that is warm (40-
120°F or 4.4-48.8°C) and moist. Lacking these condi-
tions, the bacteria transform themselves into spores that,
like plant seeds, can remain dormant for years. Clostridia
and their spores exist all over the world, especially in soil
and aquatic sediments. They do not threaten human or
animal health until the spores encounter an environment
that favors growth. The spores then germinate, and the
growing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin.
Scientists have discovered that clostridia can produce
at least seven types of botulism toxin, identified as A, B,
C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually affected by A, B, E,
and very rarely F. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cat-
tle, and mink are affected by botulism C toxin, which also
affects birds and has caused massive die-offs in domestic
bird flocks and wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin can
cause illness in cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A,
B, and C toxin. There have been no confirmed human or
animal botulism cases linked to the G toxin.
In humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific
proteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroys
them. These proteins control the release of acetyl-
choline, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle
cells. With acetylcholine release blocked, nerves are
not able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinum
toxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of med-
icine due to this action. Certain medical disorders are
characterized by involuntary and uncontrollable mus-
cle contractions. Medical researchers have discovered
that injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinum
toxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive muscle
contractions. The muscle is partially paralyzed and
normal movement is retained.
Symptoms
The three types of human botulism include the fol-
lowing symptoms:
• Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved or
stored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing clostridia.
Botulism symptoms typically appear within 18-36 hours
of eating contaminated food, with extremes of four
hours to eight days. Initial symptoms include blurred or
double vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking.
Possible gastrointestinal problems include constipation,
nausea, and vomiting. As botulism progresses, the vic-
tim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with the
head muscles and progressing down the body. Breathing
becomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care,
respiratory failureand deathare very likely.
• Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.
Unlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are vul-
nerable to C. botulinumcolonizing the intestine. Infants
ingest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore-
containing dust. The spores germinate in the large
intestine and, as the bacteria grow, they produce botu-
linum toxin that is absorbed into the infant’s body. The
first symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poor
feeding. As infant botulism progresses, sucking and
swallowing (thus eating) become difficult. A nursing
mother will often notice breast engorgement as the first
sign of her infant’s illness. The baby suffers overall
weakness and cannot control head movements. Because
of the flaccid paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears
“floppy.” Breathing is impaired, and death from respira-
tory failure is a very real danger.
• Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have been
linked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to the
extremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound botu-
lism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected wound
and produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms usually
appear four to 18 days after an injury occurs and are
similar to food-borne botulism, although gastrointesti-
nal symptoms may be absent.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp-
toms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulism
may be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome,myas-
thenia gravis, drug reactions,stroke, or nervous system
infection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide or
atropine), or shellfish poisoning. Sepsisis the most com-
mon initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure to
thrivemay also be suspected. Some reports have linked
infant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syn-
drome(SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests are
used for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems like-
ly, treatment starts immediately.
While waiting for laboratory results, doctors ask
about recently consumed food and work to dismiss other

Botulism
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 560  disease possibilities. A physical examinationis done
with an emphasis on the nervous system. As part of this
examination, CT scans, MRIs, electromyographic tests,
or lumbar punctures may be ordered. Laboratory tests
involve testing a suspected food and/or the patient’s
serum, feces, or other specimens for traces of botulinum
toxin or clostridia.
Treatment
Drugs
Adults with botulism are treated with an antitoxin
derived from horse serum that is distributed by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention. The antitoxin
(effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inactivates
only the botulinum toxin that is unattached to nerve end-
ings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually within 24 hours
of onset of symptoms) can preserve nerve endings, pre-
vent progression of the disease, and reduce mortality.
Infants, however, cannot receive the antitoxin used
for adults. For them, human botulism immune globulin
(BIG) is available in the United States through the Infant
Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program in Berkeley,
California. BIG neutralizes toxin types A, B, C, D, and E
KEY TERMS
Acetylcholine—A chemical released by nerve cells
to signal other cells.
Antitoxin—A substance that inactivates a poison
(e.g., toxin) and protects the body from being
injured by it.
CT scan—The abbreviated term for computed or
computerized axial tomography. The test involves
injecting a radioactive substance into the body.
Computers are used to scan for radiation and create
three-dimensional images of internal organs.
Electromyographic test—A medical test which
determines if a muscle’s response to electrical stim-
uli. The test results allow medical personnel to
assess how nerves to the muscle are functioning.
Flaccid paralysis—Paralysis characterized by limp,
unresponsive muscles.
Lumbar puncture—A procedure in which a small
amount of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from the
lower spine. Examination of this fluid helps diag-
nose certain illnesses.
MRI—The abbreviated term for magnetic resonance
imaging. MRI uses a large circular magnet and radio
waves to generate signals from atoms in the body.
These signals are used to construct images of inter-
nal structures.
Neurotransmitter—A chemical found in nerves
which relays nerve signals to other cells. Acetyl-
choline is a neurotransmitter.
Sepsis—The presence of infection-causing organ-
isms or associated toxins in the blood or within
body tissues.
Spores—A state of “suspended animation” that
some bacteria can adopt when conditions are not
ideal for growth. Spores are analogous to plant
seeds and can germinate into growing bacteria
when conditions are right.
Toxin—A poisonous substance produced by a
microorganism, plant, or animal.
Tracheostomy—The procedure used to open a hole
in the neck to the trachea, or windpipe. It is some-
times used in conjunction with a respirator.
before they can bind to nerves. This antitoxin can pro-
vide protection against A and B toxins for approximately
four months. Though many infants recover with support-
ive care, BIG cuts hospital stay in half, and therefore
reduces hospital costs by 50% as well.
Aside from antitoxin, no drugs are used to treat botu-
lism. Antibioticsare not effective for preventing or treating
botulism. In fact, antibiotic use is discouraged for infants
because dying bacteria could potentially release more toxin
into a baby’s system. Antibiotics can be used, however, to
treat secondary respiratory tract and other infections.
Respiratory support
Treatment for infants usually involves intensive respi-
ratory support and tube feeding for weeks or even months.
Once an infant can breathe unaided, physical therapy is
initiated to help the child relearn how to suck and swallow.
A respirator is often required to help adult patients
breathe, and a tracheostomy may also be necessary.
Surgery
Surgery may be necessary to clean an infected wound
and remove the source of the bacteria that is producing the
toxin. Antimicrobial therapy may be necessary.

Botulism
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 561  Gastric lavage
When botulism is caused by food, it often is neces-
sary to flush the gastrointestinal tract (gastric lavage).
Often cathartic agents or enemasare used. It is important
to avoid products that contain magnesium, since magne-
sium enhances the effect of the toxin.
Prognosis
With medical intervention, botulism victims can
recover completely, albeit slowly. It takes weeks to
months to recover from botulism, and severe cases can
take years before a total recovery is attained. Recovery
depends on the nerve endings building new proteins to
replace those destroyed by botulinum toxin.
Prevention
Vaccines against botulism do not exist to prevent
infant botulism or other forms of the disease. Food
safety is the surest prevention for botulism. Botulinum
toxin cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted, so the wisest
course is to discard any food that seems spoiled without
tasting it. Home canners must be diligent about using
sterile equipment and following U.S. Department of
Agriculture canning guidelines. If any part of a canned
food container is rusty or bulging, the food should not
be eaten. Infant botulism is difficult to prevent, because
controlling what goes into an infant’s mouth is often
beyond control, especially in regard to spores in the air.
One concrete preventative is to never feed honey to
infants younger than 12 months since it is one known
source of botulism spores. As infants begin eating solid
foods, the same food precautions should be followed as
for adults.

Bowel preparation
Definition
Bowel preparation is a procedure usually undertaken
before a diagnosis and /or treatment can be initiated for cer-
tain colon and rectum diseases. Bowel preparation is a
cleansing of the intestines from fecal matter and secretions.
Purpose
The ultimate goal of bowel preparation is priming the
bowel for a diagnosis procedure (using x rays to detect a
disease process in the intestines) or for surgical interven-
tion (such as removal of polyps,cancer, or narrowing of
the intestinal diameter). Colonoscopyis an effective
treatment procedure for polyps (a growing mass of tis-
sue). This procedure enables visualization of the entire
large bowel. During a colonoscopy, polyps can be cauter-
ized (applying an electric current which incinerates the
polyp). The procedure can be both diagnostic and thera-
peutic. A sigmoidoscopyscope is a flexible tube that
allows clinicians to view the sigmoid colon (the part of
the large intestine before the rectum). This procedure is
important for detection of colon/rectal cancer. It is safe,
quick to perform (usually 30–45 minutes in about 90% of
cases), and an effective diagnostic tool for evaluation of:
• rectal bleeding
• other studies that showed an abnormality
• removal of polyps
• biopsy
• evaluation of chronic diarrheaor inflammatory bowel
disease
• to detect recurrences for colon/rectal cancer or polyps
• relieving a twisted bowel
• foreign body removal
• treating bleeding lesions
• preventive surveillance of cancer in patients with a pos-
itive family history of colon cancer
Precautions
Antibiotic prophylaxisis not routinely recommend-
ed. In some cases of prosthetic heart valves,antibiotics
can be prescribed. Evidence exists that evacuation of
intestinal waste products in conjunction with antibiotics

Bowel preparation
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 562  before (prophylactic) the procedure reduces the possibili-
ty of sepsis(infection which spreads from the primary
site to blood).
Description
The bowel is emptied of any contents for procedures
such as barium enema(introducing a barium containing
chemical to promote better visualization of intestines
during x rays) or colonoscopy. Preparation of the bowel
distally—from the rectum—is necessary for diagnostic
procedures such as sigmoidoscopy. Prior to surgical pro-
cedures bowel preparation is recommended to decrease
the possibility of developing more medical problems.
Patients may also be given a course of antibiotics to pre-
vent the possibility of infection.
Preparation
Bowel preparation for visualization of the colon is per-
formed to ensure the procedure will be accurate and com-
plete. There are several effective cleansing preparations
that include: Polyethylene glycol solution, Magnesium cit-
rate with bisacodyl tablets, and Castor oil with bisacodyl
tablets. One of these preparations should be administered
starting at 4:00 
P.M. the day before the procedure.
Aftercare
After the preparation has been ingested the patient is
advised to only ingest clear liquids until midnight.
Risks
The current standard of care dictates that patients
receive antibiotic prophylaxis if they are high risk for
developing an infection. High-risk patients include those
with cardiac diseases or patients who have a prostheses.
Normal results
Absence of anatomical changes or abnormalities in
the intestines would result in normal diagnosis.
Abnormal results
Polyps can be treated with electrocautery. A biopsy
is taken of any suspicious polyps and further analyzed.
Sigmoidoscopy can detect masses, bleeding, and ulcera-
tive disease.

Bowel resection
Definition
A bowel resection is a surgical procedure in which a
part of the large or small intestine is removed.
Purpose
Bowel resection may be performed to treat various
disorders of the intestine, including cancer, obstruction,
inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum,
ischemia(compromised blood supply), or traumatic injury.
Description
The preferred type of bowel resection involves
removal of the diseased portion of intestine, and surgical-
ly re-joining the remaining ends. In this procedure, the
continuity of the bowel is maintained and normal passage
of stool is preserved. When deemed necessary by the sur-
geon, the diseased portion of the bowel may be removed,
and the functioning end of the intestine may be brought
out onto the surface of the abdomen, forming an tempo-
rary or permanent ostomy. Use of the large intestine to
form the ostomy results in a colostomy; use of small
intestine to form the ostomy results in an ileostomy.
Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is

with various x rays and an electrocardiogram (EKG) may
be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. In order to
empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed
on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A
liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before
surgery, with nothing taken by mouth after midnight. A
series of enemasand/or oral preparations (GoLytely or
Colyte), may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool.
Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or
kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacteria
in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infection.
A nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose into the
stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery. This
removes the gastric secretions and prevents nausea and
vomiting. A urinary catheter (thin tube inserted into the
bladder) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty
during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field
and decreasing chances of accidental injury.
Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient who has had a
bowel resection, as with those who have had any major
surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse,
respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be shal-
low because of the effect of anesthesia and the patient’s
reluctance to breathe deeply and experience painthat is
caused by the abdominal incision. The patient is instruct-
ed how to support the operative site during deep breath-
ing and coughing, and is given pain medication as neces-
sary. Fluid intake and output is measured, and the opera-
tive site is observed for color and amount of wound
drainage. The nasogastric tube will remain in place,
KEY TERMS
Diverticulum—Small tubes or pouches that pro-
ject off the wall of the intestine, visible as opaque
on an x ray after the patient has swallowed a con-
trast (dye) substance.
Embolism—Blockage of a blood vessel by any
small piece of material traveling in the blood. The
emboli may be caused by germs, air, blood clots,
or fat.
Ischemia—A compromise in blood supply to body
tissues that causes tissue damage or death.
Ostomy—A surgically-created opening in the
abdomen for elimination of waste products (urine
or stool).
attached to low intermittent suction until bowel activity
resumes. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenous-
ly until the patient’s diet can gradually be resumed,
beginning with liquids and advancing to a regular diet as
tolerated. The patient is generally out of bed approxi-
mately eight to 24 hours after surgery. Postoperative
weight loss follows almost all bowel resections. Weight
and strength are slowly regained over a period of months.
Risks
Potential complications of this abdominal surgery
include:
• excessive bleeding
• surgical wound infection
• incisional hernia(An organ projects through the mus-
cle wall that surrounds it. The hernia occurs through the
surgical scar.)
• thrombophlebitis (inflammation and blood clot to veins
in the legs)
• pneumonia
• pulmonary embolism(blood clot or air bubble in the
lungs’ blood supply)
Normal results
Complete healing is expected without complications
after bowel resection. The period of time required for
recovery from the surgery may vary depending of the
patient’s overall health status prior to surgery.
Abnormal results
The doctor should be made aware of any of the fol-
lowing problems after surgery:
• increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleeding
in the surgical area
• headache, muscle aches,dizziness,fever
• increased abdominal pain or swelling,constipation, nau-
sea or vomiting, rectal bleeding, or black, tarry stools

Bowel training
Definition
Bowel training helps to reestablish normal bowel
movements in persons who suffer from constipation,
diarrhea, incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowel
activity is considered one or two movements of moderate
size every day.
Purpose
Many people for many reasons have irregular bowel
function. In some cases, the irregularity lasts beyond the
condition that caused it. The bowels by themselves develop
bad habits that can be retrained with suitable exercises and
education. Normal bowel habits not only improve the qual-
ity of life, they help prevent several common diseases—for
example, diverticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones,
appendicitis,colon cancer, hiatal hernia, diabetes, and
heart disease have also been related to the quality of bowel
movements and the foods that affect them.
• One of the most common causes of constipation is the
laxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of the
bowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so that
they will no longer move without artificial stimulants.
The laxative habit begins innocently enough with the
correct belief that bowels should move every day, how-
ever,laxativeswill cause the evacuation of several days
worth of stool in a single movement. Impatient for stool
to reaccumulate for the necessary few days, the patient
takes another laxative, and the cycle begins.
• The other major cause of constipation is a diet with
insufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works more
smoothly the more contents it has. Western dietsof
highly refined foods have eliminated most of the residue
from food. The result is that most food is absorbed, leav-
ing little to pass through and be excreted as feces.
• Constipation occurs acutely with impaction—the pres-
ence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to pass.
Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowel	habits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, and	inadequate physical activity.
• Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the
bowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.
• Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel
reflexes.
Description
Bowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal
reflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.
Naturally the patient must be able and willing to cooper-
ate. Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxa-
tives that they are afraid to do without them. It takes time
for a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel to
regain its normal rhythm. Trust and patience are necessary.
After gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next step
is to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements require
ingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foods.
The patient should drink two to three quarts of liquids
every day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice and per-
haps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk comes
from unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran, brown rice,
green vegetables, apples, and pears are a few examples of
high residue foods. Many patients will benefit from
adding bulk preparations of psyllium. Constipating foods
like bananas and cheese should be avoided until a natural
rhythm is well established.
To assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily, it
is a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS
(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day as
needed. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.
There is usually a time of day when bowel move-
ments are more likely to occur. In anticipation of this
time, the patient should participate in activities that stim-
ulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating unre-
fined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee, encour-
age natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use lubricants
such as glycerine suppositories or oil enemasat this
time. For severe constipation, water enemas may be
needed to initiate a movement.
It is also important for the patient to recognize the
urge to defecate and to respond right away to that urge.
The longer stool sits in the rectum, the more water the
rectum will absorb from it, making it harder and more
difficult to pass.
Normal results
With patience and diligence, normal bowel habits
and the health that comes with them will return in most
patients.

Brain abscess
Definition
Brain abscessis a bacterial infection within the brain.
Description
The brain is usually well insulated from infection by
bacteria, protected by the skull, the meninges (tissue lay-
ers surrounding the brain), the immune system, and the
highly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the
brain. Under certain circumstances, however, bacteria
can invade the brain and cause a localized infection
called an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare,
accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Single
abscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder of
cases involve multiple abscesses. If not treated, brain
abscess is almost always fatal.
KEY TERMS
Defecate—To pass feces (stool) out of the rectum
through the anus.
Diverticulitis—Infection of outpouchings in the
large bowel.
Fecal impaction—Obstruction of the rectum by a
large mass of feces (stool).
Hiatal hernia—Part of the stomach displaced
through the diaphragm into the chest.
Causes and symptoms
One-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the
spread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources of
bacteria include:
• middle ear infections (otitis media) or infections in the
bony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis)
• sinus infections
• an abscessed tooth.
Other sources of bacteria include:
• lung infections
• abdominal infection
• infection of the heart’s lining (endocarditis)
• penetrating head wounds
• neurosurgery
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or
the presence of another immune deficiency greatly
increases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately 25%
of cases have no detectable cause of infection.
Brain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ-
isms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.
Many times brain abscess cases are caused by two or
more bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria combina-
tion includes streptococci, microorganisms that can live
without oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A small
number of cases are caused by yeast, fungi, and single-
cell organisms (protozoa).
The symptoms of brain abscess often develop slow-
ly, usually within a period of about two weeks. The most
common symptoms are:
• headache
• neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of the
brain that is infected
• altered mental status
• seizures
Feverand stiff neck occur in less than one-third of
cases. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, eye
tremor (nystagmus), poor balance, and uncoordinated
movements.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using a
computed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic reso-
nance imaging(MRI) scan to determine the site of
infection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performed
as well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type of
bacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule out
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2566
Brain abscess
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 566  tumor or other noninfectious localized lesions, which
may look the same on the scans.
Other tests are performed to determine the source of
the infection. These tests include blood cultures, x rays
of the chest, and a physical exam of the ears, sinuses, and
teeth. A test for human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV)
is usually also performed.
Treatment
Treatment for brain abscess begins with intravenous
antibiotics, chosen to match the infecting bacterium if
known, or to cover a wide spectrum of possibilities if not.
Treatment usually continues for six to eight weeks.
Aspiration surgery is almost always done to drain the
abscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the infect-
ed site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) from
the abscess. Aspiration may be repeated several times
until the bacteria are completely killed or removed. Surgi-
cal removal of infected or dead tissue may be needed in
some cases. For patients with many sites of infection,
aspiration or surgical removal is not done because of the
increased difficulty and risk of the procedure. For these
patients, antibiotic therapy alone is used. Steroid treat-
ment is controversial, but may be indicated in some cases.
Prognosis
Even with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal in
about 20% of cases. About half of those who survive
have some residual neurological problems, including
seizures in many patients.
There are several reasons why patients with brain
abscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may not
be diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis may take
additional time. The patient may receive an antibiotic
that does not match the infecting organism. Sometimes
the infection may not be limited to a definite area in the
brain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. The
small number of cases caused by fungal infection may
take additional time to diagnose. A patient may also have
a poor prognosis because there is more than one abscess,
the location of the abscess may be deep within the brain,
or the infection may have moved into many locations
within the brain. Severe complications can result from
brain abscess, including comma and brain rupture. In 80-
100% of cases involving brain rupture, the patient dies.
Prevention
Brain abscess may be preventable by prompt and
aggressive treatment of the infections which give rise to
it, especially sinus and ear infections.
KEY TERMS
Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for exami-
nation.
Aspiration—Removal of fluid from a closed space
through a needle.

Brain biopsy
Definition
A brain biopsy is the removal of a small piece of
brain tissue for the diagnosis of abnormalities of the
brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease, tumors, infection, or
inflammation.
Purpose
By examining the tissue sample under a microscope,
the biopsy sample provides doctors with the information
necessary to guide diagnosis and treatment.
Precautions
Imaging of the brain is performed to determine the
precise positioning of the needle to enter the brain.
Description
When an abnormality of the brain is suspected,
Stereotactic (probing in three dimensions) brain needle
biopsy is performed and guided precisely by a computer
system to avoid serious complications. A small hole is

brain tissue guided by computer-assisted imaging tech-
niques (CT or MRI scans). Historically, the patient’s
head was held in a rigid frame to direct the probe into the
brain; however since the early nineties, it has been possi-
ble to perform these biopsies without the frame. Since
the frame was attached to the skull with screws, this
advancement is less invasive and better tolerated by the
patient. The doctor (pathologist) prepares the sample for
analysis and studies it further under a microscope.
Preparation
A CT or MRI brain scan is done to find the position
where the biopsy will be performed. Prior to the biopsy,
the patient is placed under general anesthesia.
Aftercare
The patient is monitored in the recovery room for
several hours and is usually required to spend a few days
in the hospital since general anesthesia is required.
Risks
The procedure is invasive and includes risks associ-
ated with anesthesia and surgery. Brain injury may occur

the brain has the potential to trigger seizures.Normal results
After examining the brain tissue directly, no abnor-
malities are detected.
Abnormal results
Various brain abnormalities can be diagnosed by
microscopic analysis of the tissue sample. The pathologist
(a physician trained in how disease affects the body’s tis-
sues) looks for abnormal growth, changes in cell mem-
branes, and/or abnormal collections of cells. In Alzheimer’s
disease, the cortex of the brain contains abnormal collec-
tions of plaques. If infection is suspected, the infectious
organism can be cultured from the tissue and identified.
Classification of tumors is also possible after biopsy.

Brain tumor
Definition
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in the
brain. Unlike other tumors, brain tumors spread by local
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2568
Brain tumor
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 568  extension and rarely metastasize (spread) outside the
brain. A benign brain tumor is composed of non-cancer-
ous cells and does not metastasize beyond the part of the
brain where it originates. A brain tumor is considered
malignant if it contains cancercells, or if it is composed
of harmless cells located in an area where it suppresses
one or more vital functions.
Description
Each year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are diag-
nosed in the United States. About half of all primary
brain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening locations.
The rest are malignant and invasive.
Benign brain tumors
Benign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells,
have clearly defined borders, can usually be completely
removed, and are unlikely to recur. Benign brain tumors
do not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause severe pain,
permanent brain damage, and death. Benign brain
tumors sometimes become malignant.
Malignant brain tumors
Malignant brain tumors do not have distinct borders.
They tend to grow rapidly, increasing pressure within the
brain (IICP) and can spread in the brain or spinal cord
beyond the point where they originate. It is highly unusu-
al for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS).
Primary brain tumors
Primary brain tumors originate in the brain. They
represent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all cancer
deaths.
Metastatic or secondary brain tumors
Approximately 25% of all cancer patients develop
secondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer cells
spread from another part of the body to the brain. Sec-
ondary brain tumors are most apt to occur in patients
who have:
• breast cancer.
• colon cancer.
• kidney cancer.
• lung cancer.
• melanoma (cancer) of the skin. These metastatic brain
tumors can develop on any part of the brain or spinal
cord.
• cancer within the nasal passages and/or throat that fol-
low the nerve pathways into the skull, and metastasize
to the brain.
Who gets brain tumors
Brain tumors can develop at any age, but are most
common in children between the ages of 3-12, and in
adults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the second
most common cause of cancer death between birth and
the age of 34, and the fourth most common cause of can-
cer death in men aged 35-54. Primary tumors of the brain
and central nervous system are often associated with HIV
infection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of devel-
oping brain tumors. Other risk factors being studied
include children with a history of previous radiation treat-
ment to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers
(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an older
father; having well-educated parents; occupational expo-
sure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history of
epilepsy; history of certain genetic conditions (tuberous
sclerosis,neurofibromatosis, von Hippel Lindau,famil-
ial polyposis, Osler-Weber-Rendu, Li-Fraumeni).
Naming and grading brain tumors
The name of a brain tumor describes where it origi-
nates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it contains. A
tumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to:
• how malignant it is
• how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invade
other tissues
• how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more
abnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely to
grow)
Low-grade brain tumors usually have well-defined
borders. Some low-grade brain tumors form or are
enclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade brain
tumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread through-
out the brain, but rarely metastasize to other parts of the
body.
Mid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more rapid-
ly than low-grade tumors. Described as “truly malig-
nant,” these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue. The
growth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entire
tumor, and these tumors recur more often than low-grade
tumors.
A single brain tumor can contain several different
types of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by the
highest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under a
microscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are less
malignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any grade
that grows into surrounding tissue.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	569
Brain tumor
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 569  Types of brain tumors
Glioma is the term used to refer to the most preva-
lent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial tis-
sue, which supports and nourishes cells that send mes-
sages from the brain to other parts of the body. These
tumors may be either malignant or benign. Astrocy-
tomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are three of
the most common gliomas.
ASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of
their cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of the
brain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas grow
slowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue. Mild-to-mod-
erately anaplastic astrocytomas with well-differentiated
borders do not grow as slowly as non-infiltrating astrocy-
tomas, and they do spread to surrounding tissues.
Anaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called
Grade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and grow
more rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-moderately
anaplastic tumors.
Grade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30% of all
primary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common brain
tumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are the most malig-
nant of all brain tumors. Because they contain a greater
mixture of cells than any other brain tumor, they are the
most difficult to treat.
EPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,
ependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and 5% of
all intracranial tumors. These tumors, which are most
common in children and adolescents, begin in the very
thin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that contain it.
Ependymomas are usually benign, have well-differ-
entiated borders, resemble normal cells, and grow very
slowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant) ependymo-
mas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cells
of benign tumors.
MIXED GLIOMAS.These heterogeneous tumors con-
tain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/or
oligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that usually
occur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and do not
usually spread beyond the part of the brain where they
originate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composed
of the highest-grade cells they contain.
Non-glial brain tumors
The most common brain tumors that do not develop
from glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, and
Schwannomas.
MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought
medulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial cells.
These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now believed
to originate in developing cells not normally present in
the body after birth. They are sometimes called primitive
neurodectal tumors (PNET).
MDL tumors are most common in children and are
more common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of MDL
tumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually originate
in the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls
coordination and some muscle activity), and are often
carried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid.
MDL tumors rarely metastasize beyond the brain and
spinal cord.
MENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent
more than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate in
the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord
(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and most
often occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Menin-
giomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimes
become accustomed to their presence. Meningiomas
compress, rather than invade, brain tissue and may grow
to be quite large before any symptoms appear.
SCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the
Schwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material that
protects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing.
These benign tumors are twice as common in women as
in men, and are most often diagnosed in patients between
the ages 30-60.
Schwannomas grow very slowly, and many people
adapt to the slight hearing lossand balance problems
that are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shaped
Schwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear-
ing in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on the
nerves that control movement and feeling in the face, and
cause headaches and facial numbness or tingling. The
patient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or con-
trolling eye movements, and the sense of taste can be
affected. A Schwannoma that grows large enough to
press on the brainstem can be deadly.
CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors that
occur in children are described as supratentorial (in the
upper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in the lowest
part of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas are
common supratentorial tumors. Infratentorial tumors
include medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and ependy-
momas.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown, but
people who work with rubber and certain chemicals have
a greater-than-average risk of developing them. There is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2570
Brain tumor
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 570  no evidence that head injurycauses brain tumors, but
researchers are trying to determine the relationship, if
any, between brain tumors and viruses, family history,
and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields.
Symptoms do not usually appear until the tumor
grows large enough to displace, damage, or destroy deli-
cate brain tissue. When that happens, the patient may
experience:
• headaches that become increasingly painful and are
most painful when lying down
• nausea and vomiting or sudden attacks of vomiting not
accompanied by nausea
• seizures
• dizziness, loss of coordination or balance
• personality changes
• sudden loss of vision
• memory loss
• speech problems
• sensory changes
• mental impairment
• weakness or paralysison one side of the body
A doctor should be notified whenever a patient expe-
riences one or more of the symptoms.
Diagnosis
Although brain tumor symptoms resemble those of
many other illnesses, the presence of a brain tumor may
be indicated by:
• persistent headaches with vomiting or convulsions
• progressive deterioration of sight, speech, hearing,
touch; or deterioration in the ability to use an arm,
hand, foot, or leg
When a patient experiences one or more of the
above symptoms, a primary care physician will perform
a complete physical examination, take a detailed med-
ical history, and conduct a basic neurologic examination
to evaluate:
• balance and coordination
• abstract thinking and memory
• eye movements
• hearing, touch, and sense of smell
• reflexes
• control of facial muscles and movements of the head
and tongue
• awareness
If the results of these examinations suggest a patient
may have a brain tumor, a neurologist recommends some
or all of these additional diagnostic tests:
• computed tomography scan (CT scan) to reveal brain
abnormalities
• magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tumors
beneath the bones of the skull
• complex imaging techniques such as Positron emis-
sion tomography(PETscan), Single photon emission
tomography (SPECT scan)
• electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrical
activity in the brain
• magnetoencephalography (MEG scan) to measure the
magnetic fields produced by nerve cells and their elec-
tric currents
• x rays to reveal any distortion in the bones of the skull
• angiography to outline a tumor and the blood vessels
that lead to it
• a brain scan to identify and record the location of
abnormal cells in the brain
• radionuclide brain scintigraphy to view the capillaries
feeding the tumor after highlighting them with a
radioactive substance

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 571  • myelography (x ray of the spine) to detect a spinal cord
tumor
• a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to obtain spinal fluid,
which may contain tumor cells.
• digital holography to view a complete three-dimension-
al map of the tumor and surrounding brain structures
Interpreting these images and results of laboratory
analysis allows neurologists to determine whether a
tumor is present, but microscopic examination of tumor
tissue (biopsy) is the only way to identify the kind of
cells it contains.
Treatment
Brain tumors are treated by multidisciplinary teams
of highly skilled specialists whose decisions are based on:
• results of diagnostic tests
• tumor size, position, and growth pattern
• the patient’s health history and current medical status
• the wishes of the patient and his family
Surgery
Surgery is the treatment of choice for accessible
brain tumors, which can be removed without causing
serious neurologic damage. The procedure most often
performed is a craniotomy, but the goals of any type of
brain tumor surgery include:
• removing as much of the tumor as possible (called
debulking the tumor)
• removing tumor tissue for microscopic analysis
• allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor is
situated and how it is growing
• creating an entry channel for chemotherapydrugs and
forms of radiation that are implanted in the brain
Depending on the type of brain tumor, its location,
and its size, a number of different techniques may be
used to surgically remove it. Surgical techniques include:
• classic operation
• laser microsurgery (uses high temperatures to vaporize
tumor cells
• ultrasonic aspiration (uses ultrasound waves to break up
the tumor into smaller bits which can be “vacuumed”
out
Before undergoing brain surgery, patients are often
given:
• steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue
• snticonvulsant medications to prevent or control seizures
• radiation treatments to reduce tumor size
Patients whose benign brain tumors can be com-
pletely removed may not require any additional treat-
ment, but periodic physical and neurologic examinations
and CT or MRI scans are sometimes recommended to
determine whether the tumor has returned. Because sur-
geons cannot be sure that every bit of an infiltrating or
metastasizing tumor has been removed, radiation and
chemotherapy are used to eradicate cells that may have
escaped the scalpel.
If a tumor cannot be completely removed, removing
a portion of it (debulking) can alleviate the patient’s
symptoms, enhance the sense of well-being, and increase
the effectiveness of other treatments.
Radiation therapy
External radiotherapy, generally delivered on an out-
patient basis, directs radiation to the tumor and the area
around it. Implant radiation therapyinvolves placing tiny
pieces of radioactive material in the brain. Left in place
permanently, or for a short time, these radioactive pellets
release measured doses of radiation each day. This tech-
nique is called brachytherapy. Patients are usually hospi-
talized during the several days the pellets are most active.
Stereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the patient
with a frame to stabilize the head, using imaging tech-
niques to determine the exact location of tumor cells, and
using a sophisticated instrument to administer radiation
precisely to that point. Instruments used for delivery of
radiation include the gamma knife, adapted linear accel-
erator (LINAC), and cyclotron.
A variety of drugs may also be given during radia-
tion therapy, to protect brain cells from the effects of
radiation (radioprotective drugs), to increase the sensitiv-
ity of tumor cells to radiation (radiosensitizers), or to
boost radiation’s effects (radioenhancers).
Chemotherapy
One or more cancer-killing drugs may be taken by
mouth or injected into a blood vessel, muscle, or the cere-
brospinal fluid. Chemotherapy may be used with radia-
tion and surgery as part of a patient’s initial treatment, or
used alone to treat tumors that recur in the same place or
in another part of the body. The usual chemotherapy regi-
men for a brain tumor is a combination approach, most
commonly using procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine.
New methods of delivering chemotherapy are being
used as well. These include:
• interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time of
surgery. A chemotherapy-soaked wafer is placed in the
cavity left after tumor removal.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2572
Brain tumor
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 572  • Intrathecal chemotherapy instills the medications right
into the spinal fluid.
• Intraarterial chemotherapy uses tiny catheter tubes to
delivery high-dose chemotherapy directly into the arter-
ies of the brain.
• Potentially toxic chemotherapy drugs can be wrapped
in special biologic envelopes called liposomes, to allow
the drugs to be delivered to the tumor without adversely
affecting other healthy tissues along the way.
• Electrochemotherapy uses electric voltage to transport
chemotherapy agents into the brain.
When a young child has a brain tumor, chemotherapy
is often used to eliminate or delay the need for radiation.
Other treatments
If a brain tumor cannot be cured, treatment is
designed to make the patient as comfortable as possible
and preserve as much of his neurologic functioning as
possible. The patient’s doctor may prescribe:
• analgesics to relieve pain
• anticancer drugs to limit tumor growth
• anticonvulsants to control seizures
• steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue
Potential therapies
Scientists are studying ways to empower chemother-
apy drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (which
protects the CNS by separating the brain from blood cir-
culating throughout the body), and attack cancer cells
that have infiltrated tissue inside it. Agents under investi-
gation include both mannitol and substances called
receptor-mediated permeabilizers
Brain tumor researchers are also investigating:
• Less invasive surgical procedures.
• Monoclonal antibodies, which pair antibodies with
radioactive substances. The antibodies are directed to
find and attach to tumor cells, at which time the
radioactive substance kills the tumor cell.
• Interleukin and interferon, which are substances pro-
duced naturally by the human immune system which
seem to kill tumor cells. Scientists seek to produce
these substances in the laboratory and incorporate their
use in brain tumor treatment.
• T-lymphocytes, which are also produced normally by
the human immune system, and are being used to inject
directly into the tumor location during surgery and to
infuse into the bloodstream after surgery, in the hopes
that they will boost the immune system’s ability to fight
tumor cells.
• Tumor vaccines, which use elements of tumor cells to
stimulate the patient’s immune system.
• Methods of incorporating chemotherapy drugs into
tumor cells to reduce the need for radiation.
• Laboratory techniques that enable physicians to select
the chemotherapy drugs most likely to kill particular
types of tumors.
• Gene therapy in which genetically engineered material
is transported to tumor cells by viruses that infect tumor
cells and convert them to normal cells, stop their
growth, or kill them.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments have not been shown to cure
brain tumors and should never be substituted for conven-
tional therapy. However, complementary therapies (used
with, not instead of, standard treatments) can help some
patients cope with the stressof their illness and side
effects of their treatment.
Biofeedbackcan teach patients to influence and
control heart rate, muscle tension, and other stress-relat-
ed body functions. Some patients claim that guided
imagery(visualization) helps them feel healthier and
more in control of their disease.
Massage,meditation, and reflexologyhelp some
patients relax; while yogais said to soothe the body, spir-
it, and mind. Hydrotherapyuses ice, liquid, and steam
to improve circulation and relieve pain. Therapeutic
touchpractitioners say they can relieve pain and other
symptoms by moving their hands in slow, rhythmic
motions several inches above the patient’s body.
Botanical therapies, homeopathic treatment,tradi-
tional Chinese medicinetreatments, nutritional focuses
on diet and supplements, and detoxificationcan also be
incorporated as complementary therapies.
Prognosis
The patient’s prognosis depends on where the tumor
is located, what type of cells it contains, the size of the
tumor, and the effect its already had on adjacent brain
structures. A patient whose tumor is discovered early and
removed completely may make a full recovery, but the
surgery itself can harm or destroy normal brain tissue
and cause:
• problems with thought, speech, and coordination
• seizures
• weakness
• personality changes

Occupational therapy can teach patients and their
families new ways to approach daily tasks. Physical ther-
apy can benefit patients who have difficulty keeping their
balance, expressing their thoughts, speaking, or swallow-
ing. Children may need special tutors before and after

brain tumors, hospice care may be available. Hospices
provide a supportive environment and help patients man-
age pain and remain comfortable.
Consequences of radiation therapy
Cells killed by radiation can cluster in the brain,
resembling tumors. They can cause headaches, seizures,
and memory loss. Children treated with radiation may
lose some of their eyesight and develop learning prob-
lems. Radiation damage to the pituitary gland can hinder
normal growth and development.
Consequences of chemotherapy
Some drugs used to treat brain tumors can cause kid-
ney damage and temporary or permanent tingling in the
fingers and ringing in the ears.
Inoperable tumors
Brain tumors that cannot be removed may cause
irreversible brain damage and death.
Prevention
The cause of primary brain tumors has not been
determined, so there is no known way to prevent them.

Breast biopsy
Definition
A breast biopsy is removal of breast tissue for exam-
ination by a pathologist. This can be accomplished surgi-
cally, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.
Purpose
A biopsy is recommended when a significant
abnormality is found, either on physical examination
and/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality can
include a breast lump felt during physical self examina-
tion or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test.
Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to make
sure that the threat of cancercannot be disproved or
ruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination. A
lump may be obviously harmless when examined by
ultrasound. If this is not decisive, the presence of cancer
or a variety of benign breast conditions can be deter-
mined using a biopsy.
Precautions
The type of biopsy recommended should be consid-
ered. This will depend on whether the area can be felt,
how well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasound,
and how suspicious it feels or appears. Specialized
equipment is needed for different types of biopsy and
availability may vary. Generally, needle biopsy is less
invasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most,
but not all situations. However, some surgeons feel it is
far less accurate.
Description
Surgical biopsy
If an abnormality is not felt during a self examina-
tion, there are signs that indicate the need for medical
attention. These include:
• severe breast pain
• changes in the size of a breast or the nipple
• changes in the shape of both breast or nipple
• pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin
• nipple redness, irritation, or inversion
• changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface of
the breast
• some types of nipple discharge
If the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization
must be done before the actual surgery. After local anes-
thetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the area of
concern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used. The
patient is awake and usually sitting up.
There are two types of breast biopsy considered
here, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is a
surgical procedure, where the entire area of concern and
some surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually done as
an outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free standing
surgery center. The patient may be awake, and is some-
times given medication to make her drowsy. The area to
be operated on is numbed with local anesthetic. Infre-
quently, general anesthesia is used.
An excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one
hour. The total amount of time spent at the facility
depends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a needle
localization was done, and the extent of the surgery.
If a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may be
performed. In this case only a portion of the area is
removed and sent for analysis. The procedure is the same
as an excisional biopsy in other respects.
Needle biopsy
A needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious area
for examination. There are two types, aspiration biopsy
(using a fine needle), and large core needle biopsy. Either
of these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy. Per-
cutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin.
A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee-
dle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied. It can
be done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. Local
anesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as it
may be more painful than the biopsy needle. The area to
place the needle may be located by touch. No specialized
equipment is needed. However, using ultrasound guid-
ance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion at
the same time. The actual withdrawing of fluid and cells
can be visualized as it occurs. This helps ensure that the
specimen is taken from the right place.
A large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter
needle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size of
a grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital that
has the appropriate facilities. Local anesthetic is routine-

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 575  ly used. Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a
large core needle biopsy.
If the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a stereo-
tactic device is used. This means that x rays are taken from
several angles. This information is fed into a computer,
which analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correct
place. The patient may be sitting up, or she may be lying on
her stomach, with her breast positioned through an opening
in the table. The breast is held firmly, but comfortably
between a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to those
used for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the front
and side of the breast). X rays may be taken before, during,
and after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm that
the correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may also be
referred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a mammotomy.
Ultrasound is used to guide needle placement for
some lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After the
area is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician places
a transducer, an instrument about the size of an electric
shaver, over the skin. This produces an image from the
reflection of sound waves. A special needle, usually in a
spring loaded device, is used to obtain the tissue. The pro-
cedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening.
Preparation
A surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to
have nothing to eat or drink for a period of time before
the operation. This will typically be from midnight the
night before, if general anesthesia is planned. No food
restrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advis-
able to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especially
important if the patient will be lying on her stomach for a
stereotactic biopsy.
Aftercare
After a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closed
with stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandage
can usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches are
taken out approximately one week afterward. Depending
on the extent of the operation, normal activities can be
resumed in approximately one to three days. Vigorous
exercisemay be limited for one to three weeks.
The skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal. It
may be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip, or
covered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage. The
patient can return to her usual routine immediately after
the biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not rec-
ommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be removed
one or two days after the biopsy.
Risks
Infection is always a possibility when the skin is
broken, although this rarely occurs. Redness, swelling, or
severe pain at the biopsy site would indicate a possible

Fine needle aspiration biopsy

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 576  infection. Another possible consequence of a breast biop-
sy is a hematoma. This is a collection of blood at the
biopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body.
If it is very large and uncomfortable, it may need to be
drained. A surgical breast biopsy may produce a visible
scar on the breast. Sometimes this may make future
mammograms harder to interpret accurately.
A false negative pathology report is another risk.
This means that no cancer was found when a cancer was
present. The incidence of this varies with the biopsy
technique. In general, fine needle aspiration biopsies
have the highest rate of false negative results, but there
may be variation in results between facilities.
Normal results
A normal pathology report indicates no malignancy
is present. The tissue sample may be further classified as
a benign breast condition, such as tumor of the breast
(fibroadenoma) or connective tissue that resembles
fiber (fibrosis). Studies have demonstrated that approxi-
mately 80% of all breast biopsies result in a benign
pathology report.
Abnormal results
An abnormal pathology report indicates a cancer is
present. If a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed,
the pathologist has viewed individual cells under a
microscope to see if they appear cancerous. Large core
needle biopsy and surgical biopsy will be able to give
more information. This includes the type of cancer,
whether it has invaded surrounding tissue, and how likely
it is to spread quickly. There are some conditions which
are not malignant but indicate high risk for future devel-
opment of breast cancer. If these are identified, more
frequent monitoring of the area may be recommended.

Breast cancer
Definition
Breast canceris caused by the development of
malignant cells in the breast. The malignant cells origi-
nate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breast
(ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer.
Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled division
leading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cells
to invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughout
the body, in a process called metastasis.
Description
Breast cancer arises in the milk-producing glands of
the breast tissue. Groups of glands in normal breast tis-
sue are called lobules. The products of these glands are
secreted into a ductal system that leads to the nipple.
Depending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of the
breast the cancer arises, it will develop certain character-
istics that are used to sub-classify breast cancer into
types. The pathologist will denote the subtype at the time
of evaluation with the microscope. Ductal carcinoma
begins in the ducts, lobular carcinoma has a pattern
involving the lobules or glands. The more important clas-
sification is related to the evaluated tumor’s capability to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	577
Breast cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 577  invade, as this characteristic defines the disease as a true
cancer. The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ,
meaning that the early malignancy has not yet become
capable of invasion. Thus, ductal carcinoma in situ is
considered a minimal breast cancer.
How breast cancer spreads
The primary tumor begins in the breast itself but once
it becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the breast to
the regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to other
organ systems in the body and become systemic in nature.
Lymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells
throughout the body. Lymph will work its way back to the
bloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics.
Along the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta-
tions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes.
Nearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph node
group filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes from
that organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes are
under the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumor
begins in the breast and the first place to which it is likely
to spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as it
invades in its place of origin, may also work its way into
blood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, the
blood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer to
spread to other organs of the body.
Breast cancer follows this classic progression though
it often becomes systemic or widespread early in the
course of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump in
the breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in size
and contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that a
tumor of this size may take one to five years to develop.
During that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spread
by lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body.
When primary breast cancer spreads, it may first go
to the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil-
lary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If it
proceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-borne
spread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that may
involve a number of other organs in the body. Favorite
sites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are the
lung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turns
out, the presence of, and the actual number of, regional
lymph nodes containing cancer remains the single best
indicator of whether or not the cancer has become widely
metastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in other
organs may not be sensitive enough to reveal minute
deposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta-
sis becomes very important in making treatment deci-
sions for this disease.
If breast cancer spreads to other major organs of the
body, its presence will compromise the function of those
organs. Deathis the result of extreme compromise of
vital organ function.
Demographics
Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she lives
to be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she will
develop the condition sometime during her life. As a
woman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer rises
dramatically regardless of her family history. The breast
cancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of
19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less than 5% of
cases are discovered before age 35 and the majority of all
breast cancers are found in women over age 50.
In 1999, there were 180,000 new cases of breast can-
cer diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancer
each year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by cancer
in women. For the first time ever, mortality rates decreased
an average of 1.7% per year from 1995 through 1999, a
reflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies.
Causes and symptoms
There are a number of risk factors for the develop-
ment of breast cancer, including:
• family history of breast cancer in mother or sister
• early onset of menstruation and late menopause
• reproductive history: women who had no children or
have children after age 30 and women who have never
breastfed have increased risk
• history of abnormal breast biopsies
Though these are recognized risk factors, it is impor-
tant to note that more than 70% of women who get breast
cancer have no known risk factors. Having several risk
factors may boost a woman’s chances of developing
breast cancer, but the interplay of predisposing factors is
complex. In addition to those accepted factors listed
above, some studies suggest that high-fat diets,obesity,
or the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profile.
Another factor that may contribute to a woman’s risk
profile is hormone replacement therapy(HRT).
HRT provides significant relief of menopausal
symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly pro-
tection from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Howev-
er, studies show that there is a small increased risk of
developing breast cancer with HRT use. Thus, the use of
hormone replacement therapy should be based on per-
sonal risk factors.
Of all the risk factors listed above, family history is
the most important. In The Biological Basis of Cancer,
the authors estimate that probably about half of all famil-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2578
Breast cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 578  ial breast cancer cases (families in which there is a high
breast cancer frequency) have mutations affecting the
tumor suppressor gene BRCA-1. Another gene (BRCA-
2) also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to early-
onset breast cancers. However, breast cancer due to
heredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases;
only 5%–10% of all breast cancer cases will be women
who inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev-
ertheless, when the family history is strong for develop-
ment of breast cancer, a woman’s risk is increased.
Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.
Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common.
Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast, fibro-
cystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumps
in the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms of
pain, swelling, or discharge and may become evident to
the patient or physician as a lump that is either solid or
filled with fluid. Complete diagnostic evaluation of any
significant breast abnormality is mandatory because
though women commonly develop fibrocystic changes,
breast cancer is common also, and the signs and symptoms
of fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the
biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor-
mality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal of
tissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram is
a low-dose, 2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) The
patient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding a
lump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling,
nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, the
patient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and a
lump is detected by the mammogram.
When a patient has no signs or symptoms
Screening involves the evaluation of women who
have no symptoms or signs of a breast problem, so when
the screening mammogram leads to the evaluation, the
patient has no symptoms and may not have any abnor-
mality on examination of the breast. Mammographyhas
been very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one can-
not identify on physical examination. However,
10%–13% of breast cancer does not show up on mam-
mography, and a similar number of patients with breast
cancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normal
physical examination. These figures emphasize the need
for examination as part of the screening process.
Screening
It is recommended that women get into the habit of
doing monthly breast self examinations to detect any
lump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump is
found, evaluation by an experienced physician and mam-
mography is recommended. The American Cancer Soci-
ety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use of
mammography on a screening basis. There has been con-
troversy about the timing and appropriate frequency of
mammography when used as a screening tool, but the
ACS recommendations are as follows: Women should
get annual mammograms after age 40. Those with a sig-
nificant family history (one or more first-degree relatives
who have been treated for breast cancer), should start
annual mammograms 10 years younger than the
youngest relative was when she was diagnosed, but not
earlier than 35.
Because of the greater awareness of breast cancer in
recent years, screening evaluations by examinations and
mammography are performed much more frequently than
in the past. The result is that the number of breast cancers
diagnosed increased, but the disease is being diagnosed at
an earlier stage than previously. The earlier the stage of

term outcome after treatment, or prognosis, becomes.
When a patient has physical signs or symptoms
A very common finding that leads to diagnosis is the
presence of a lump within the breast. Skin dimpling, nip-
ple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less fre-
quent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though bloody
nipple discharge is distressing, it is most often caused by
benign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple retraction in the
presence of an underlying breast mass on examination is
a more advanced finding. Actual skin involvement, with
edemaor ulceration of the skin, are late findings.
A very common presenting sign is the presence of a
breast lump. If the lump is suspicious and the patient has
not had a mammogram by this point, a study should be
done on both breasts prior to anything else so that the
original characteristics of the lesion can be studied. The
opposite breast should also be evaluated mammographi-
cally to determine if other problems exist that were unde-
tected by physical examination.
Whether an abnormal screening mammogram or one
of the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogram
prompted suspicion, the diagnosis is established by
obtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There are different
types of biopsy, each utilized with its own indication
depending on the presentation of the patient. If signs of
widespread metastasis are already present, biopsy of the
metastasis itself may establish diagnosis.
Biopsy
Depending on the situation, different types of biopsy
may be performed. The types include incisional and exci-
sional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physician
takes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy, the
mass is removed. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and core
needle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies.
FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY.In a fine needle
aspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed into
the lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the nee-
dle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluation
(cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple discharge
can have a sample taken of the discharge for cytological
evaluation, also.) Fine needle aspiration is a simple pro-
cedure that can be done under local anesthesia, and will
tell if the lesion is a fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid.
The sample obtained will yield much diagnostic informa-
tion. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent tech-
nique when the lump is palpable and the physician can
easily hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a sim-
ple cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass will
disappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.
Care must be taken, however, because if the mass is solid
and the specimen is non-malignant, a complete removal
of the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.
CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY.Core needle biopsies are also
obtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger piece
of tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may be
helpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgical
removal. An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarely
needed for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. If
there remains question as to diagnosis, a complete open
surgical biopsy may be required.
EXCISIONAL BIOPSY.When performed, the excision-
al, (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatient
procedure often done under local anesthesia.
NON-PALPABLE LESIONS.As screening increases,
non-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammogra-
phy are becoming more common. The use of x rays and
computers to guide the needle for biopsy or to place
markers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsy
are commonly employed. Some benign lesions can be
fully removed by multiple directed core biopsies. These
techniques are very appealing because they are minimal-
ly invasive; however, the physician needs to be careful to
obtain a good sample.
Other tests
If a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char-
acteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilized
both to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacua-
tion. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guide
fine needle or core biopsies of the breast.
Computed tomography (CT scan, CAT scans), and
magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), have only a very
occasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions.
Treatment
Staging
Once diagnosis is established, before treatment is
rendered, more tests are done to determine if the cancer
has spread beyond the breast. These tests include a chest
x rayand blood countwith liver function tests. Along
with the liver function measured by the blood sample, the
level of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme from bone, is
also determined. A radionuclear bone scan may be
ordered. This test looks at the places in the body to which
breast cancer usually metastasizes. A CT scan may also
be ordered. The physician will do a careful examination
of the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasis
but unfortunately this exam is not very accurate. Since

Breast cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 580  the axillary node status is the best reflection of possible
widespread disease, these nodes in part or all will be
removed at the time of surgical treatment.
Using the results of these studies, clinical stage is
defined for the patient. This helps define treatment proto-
col and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, or
pathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymph
node status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail-
able from the American Joint Commission on Cancer
Manual and are generalized here:
• Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and
no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.
• Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and the
cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
• Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-
er than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, which
have grown into each other.
• Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,
(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chest
wall, along the breastbone.
• Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes
beyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.
Treatment
Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapyare all uti-
lized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on the
stage, they will be used in different combinations or
sequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the type
and stage of the disease being treated.
SURGERY.Historically, surgical removal of the
entire breast and axillary contents along with the muscles
down to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera-
py, (radical mastectomy). In the last twenty-five years,
as it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys-
temic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima-
ry but of less and less magnitude.
Today, surgical treatment is best thought of as a
combination of removal of the primary tumor and stag-
ing of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast is
removed along with the entire axillary contents, but the
muscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radical
mastectomy has been performed.
If the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size and
located so that it can be removed without destroying a
reasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast,
just the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will be
removed. The axillary nodes will still be removed for
staging purposes, usually through a separate incision.
Because of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breast
tissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of local
recurrence. This type of primary therapy is known as
lumpectomy, (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary
dissection.
Currently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec-
tion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy,a
technique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drain
the tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam-
pling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma the
patient experiences.
When patients are selected appropriately based on
the preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgical
approaches have been shown to produce similar results.
In planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative that
the operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance of
the patient.
The pathologic stage is determined after surgical
treatment absolutely defines the local parameters. In
addition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces-
sary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling of
the surgical specimen is thus very important. The tissue
needs to be analyzed for the presence or absence of hor-
mone receptors and a receptor called HER-2. The pres-
ence of these receptors will influence additional thera-

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 581  pies. Microscopic evaluation may also include the
assessment of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion as
these predict a worse outcome. The DNA of the tumor
cells is quantitatively analyzed to help decide the biolog-
ic aggressiveness of the tumor. These parameters will be
utilized collectively along with the axillary lymph node
status to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the can-
cer. This assessment, along with the age and general con-
dition of the patient, will be considered when planning
the adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatments
utilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that no
microscopic disease exists and to help prolong patients’
survival time.
RADIATION.Like surgical therapy,radiation thera-
pyis a local modality—it treats the tissue exposed to it
and not the rest of the body. Radiation is usually given
post-operatively after surgical woundshave healed. The
pathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known and
this aids in treatment planning. The extent of the local
surgery also influences the planning. Radiation may not
be needed at all after modified radical mastectomy for
stage I disease, but is almost always utilized when breast-
preserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was exten-
sive or if multiple nodes were involved, the field of tissue
exposed will vary accordingly. Radiation is utilized as an
adjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an important
modality in gaining local control of the tumor. The use of
radiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvant
treatment. In the past, radiation was used as an alternative
to surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-pre-
serving surgical protocols have been developed, primary
radiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performed.
Radiation also has an important role in the treatment of
the patient with disseminated disease, particularly if it
involves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can effect pain
control and prevention of fracture in this circumstance.
DRUG THERAPY.Many breast cancers, particularly
those originating in post-menopausal women, are
responsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors on
their cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of primary
tumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evalu-
ation for the presence of these estrogen and progesterone
receptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, altering
the hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumor
growth and have a positive impact on survival. The drug
tamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells so
that the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing,
inhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptors
present, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five years
as an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonal
therapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they have
to be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evalu-
ation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hor-
mone environment are under study. Because of these
agents, there is rarely any need for surgical removal of
hormone-producing glands, such as the ovary or adrenal,
that was sometimes necessary in the past.
Shortly after the modified radical mastectomy
replaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical
treatment, it was appreciated that survival after local
treatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by the
addition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an
interval of four to six months is now standard treatment
for patients with stage II disease. The addition of sys-
temic therapy to local treatment in patients who have no
evidence of disease is performed on the basis that some
patients have metastasis that are not currently demonstra-
ble because they are microscopic. By treating the whole
patient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, the
adjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly
60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treat-
ment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate,
and 5-flourouracil, (CMF), is given for six months and is
well tolerated. The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (dox-
orubicin), and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxic
but only requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxin
may also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) The
two methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvant
hormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemo-
therapy as they work through different routes.
As one would expect, the encouraging results from
adjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the study
of similar therapy in stage I disease. The results are not
as dramatic, but they are real. Currently, stage I disease is
divided into categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumor
size. Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adju-
vant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly rec-
ommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity of
the treatment must be weighed individually for the
patient as patients with stage I disease have a survivor-
ship of over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.
If patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or, in
spite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread dis-
ease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a more
aggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con-
taining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)
have been found to be effective in inducing remission.
On the basis of prognostic factors such as total num-
ber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA with a
high synthesis value, or aggressive findings on micro-
scopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or III dis-
ease can be predicted to do poorly. If their performance
status allows, they can be considered for treatment with
highly aggressive chemotherapy. The toxicity is such that
bone marrow failure will result. To get around this antici-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2582

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 582  pated side effect of the aggressive therapy, either the
patients will be transplanted with their own stem cells,
(the cells that will give rise to new marrow), or a tradi-
tional bone marrow transplantationwill be required.
This therapy can be a high-risk procedure for patients. It
is given with known risk to patients predicted to do poor-
ly and then only if it is felt they can tolerate it. Most
patients who receive this therapy receive it as part of a
clinical trial. At present, it is unclear that such aggressive
therapy can be justified and it is under study.
For patients who are diagnosed with advanced local
disease, surgery may be preceded with chemotherapy
and radiation therapy. The disease locally regresses
allowing traditional surgical treatment to those who
could not receive it otherwise. Chemotherapy and some-
times radiation therapy will continue after the surgery.
The regimens of this type are referred to as neo-adjuvant
therapy. This has been proven to be effective in stage III
disease. Neo-adjuvant therapy is now being studied in
patients with large tumors that are stage II in an effort to
be able to offer breast preservation to these patients.
A drug known as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a mono-
clonal antibody, is now being used in the treatment of
those with systemic disease. The product of the Human
KEY TERMS
Adjuvant therapy—Treatment involving radiation,
chemotherapy (drug treatment), or hormone thera-
py, or a combination of all three given after the pri-
mary treatment for the possibility of residual micro-
scopic disease.
Aneuploid—An abnormal number of chromosomes
in a cell.
Aspiration biopsy—The removal of cells in fluid or
tissue from a mass or cyst using a needle for micro-
scopic examination and diagnosis.
Benign—Not malignant, noncancerous.
Biopsy—A procedure in which suspicious tissue is
removed and examined by a pathologist for cancer
or other disease. For breast biopsies, the tissue may
be obtained by open surgery, or through a needle.
Estrogen-receptor assay—A test to see if a breast
cancer needs estrogen to grow.
Hormones—Chemicals produced by glands in the
body which circulate in the blood and control the
actions of cells and organs. Estrogens are hormones
which affect breast cancer growth.
Hormone therapy—Treating cancers by changing
the hormone balance of the body, instead of by
using cell-killing drugs.
Lumpectomy—A surgical procedure in which only
the cancerous tumor in the breast is removed,
together with a rim of normal tissue.
Lymph nodes—Small, bean-shaped masses of tissue
scattered along the lymphatic system that act as fil-
ters and immune monitors, removing fluids, bacte-
ria, or cancer cells that travel through the lymph
system. Breast cancer cells in the lymph nodes
under the arm or in the chest are a sign that the can-
cer has spread, and that it might recur.
Malignant—Cancerous.
Mammography—X-ray imaging of the breast that
can often detect lesions in the tissue too small or
too deep to be felt.
Oncogene—A gene that has to do with regulation
of cancer growth. An abnormality can produce
cancer.
Epidermal Growth Factor 2 gene, (HER-2) is overex-
pressed in 25%–30% of breast cancers. Herceptin binds
to the HER-2 receptors on the cancer, resulting in the
arrest of growth of these cells.
Prognosis
The prognosis for breast cancer depends on the type
and stage of cancer. Over 80% of stage I patients are
cured by current therapies. Stage II patients survive over-
all about 70% of the time, those with more extensive
lymph nodal involvement doing worse than those with
disease confined to the breast. About 40% of stage III
patients survive five years, and about 20% of stage IV
patients do so.
Coping with cancer treatment
Surgery for breast cancer is physically well-tolerated
by the patient, especially those undergoing minimal
surgery in the axilla. Most patients can return to a normal
lifestyle within a month or so after surgery. Exercises can
help the patient regain strength and flexibility. Arm,
shoulder, and chest exercises help, and complete recov-
ery of activity is to be expected.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	583
Breast cancer
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 583  About 5-7% of patients undergoing complete axil-
lary lymph node resection as part of their therapy may
develop clinically significant lymphedema, or swelling
in the arm on the side of involvement. If present, eleva-
tion and massage may be needed intermittently. Though
usually not serious, on occasion this complication may
interfere with complete physical recovery. The incidence
of lymphedema is less with less axillary surgery. This is
the reason for the enthusiasm for sentinel node biopsy as
the surgical staging procedure in the axilla.
It is common after breast cancer treatment to be
depressed or moody, to cry, lose appetite, or feel unwor-
thy or less interested in sex. The breast is involved with a
woman’s identity and loss of it may be disturbing. For
some, counseling or a support group can help. Many
women have found a support group of breast cancer sur-
vivors to be an invaluable help during this stage. Involve-
ment with volunteers from the local chapter of the Reach
to Recovery program may be very helpful.
Nearly all patients undergo some form of adjuvant
therapy for breast cancer. The magnitude of the toxicity of
these adjuvant therapies is usually small and many patients
receiving chemotherapy on this basis are capable of normal
activity during this time. Certainly, those who progress to
advanced disease are treated with more toxic chemothera-
peutic regimens in an attempt to induce remission.
Clinical trials
The use of tamoxifen and other agents which alter
the hormone status of the patient are under study. The
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
(NSABP) with support from the National Cancer Insti-
tute began a study in 1992 (called the Breast Cancer Pre-
vention Trial, or BCPT) studying the use of tamoxifen as
a breast cancer preventative for high-risk women. The
results yielded from the study showed that tamoxifen sig-
nificantly reduced breast cancer risk, and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approved the use of tamoxifen
to reduce breast cancer risk for high-risk patients in
1998. Another NSABP study, known as STAR, is seek-
ing to understand if another drug, raloxifene, is as effec-
tive as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in high-
risk patients. That study was begun in 1999, and partici-
pants are to be monitored for five years.
Neo-adjuvant therapies to allow the use of breast
preservation in those with more advanced local disease
are under investigation.
Immune therapies have not been helpful to date
though there are vaccines being developed against pro-
teins such as that produced by HER-2 that may be bene-
ficial in the future.
High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescue
remains controversial. Factors can be identified that pre-
dict certain patients will develop metastatic disease. This
treatment has been offered to this select group of patients
but the toxicity is such that defining a clear indication for
this treatment remains under study.
Prevention
As mentioned above, because of the results yielded
from the BCPT clinical trial, tamoxifen can now be pre-
scribed to high-risk women to help prevent breast cancer.
And, while most breast cancer can’t be prevented, it
can be diagnosed from a mammogram at an early stage
when it is most treatable. The results of awareness and
routine screening have allowed earlier diagnosis, which
results in a better prognosis for those discovered.
Special Concerns
Though breast-preserving therapy is being done more
frequently than in years past, modified radical mastectomy
remains an option when selecting therapy for the primary
tumor. This option may allow treatment without radiation
in earlier stage patients, or may be necessary if the presen-
tation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation. Loss
of the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treated
desire reconstruction of the breast. Breast reconstruction
is performed either at the time of initial surgery (immedi-
ate) or it may be delayed. Alternatives include placement of
implants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the abdomen
or back. Most agree that breast preservation gives superior
results to any form of reconstruction. When the breast is
removed as part of primary therapy, these reconstructions
are available and do produce very reasonable results.

Breast-feeding seeLactation
Breast implants
Definition
Breast implantation is a surgical procedure for
enlarging the breast. Breast-shaped sacks made of a sili-
cone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline (salt
water), called implants, are used.
Purpose
Breast implantation is usually performed to make
normal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes. Sometimes
a woman having a breast reconstructionafter a mastec-
tomywill need the opposite breast enlarged to make the
breasts more symmetric. Breasts that are very unequal in
size due to trauma or congenital deformity may also be
corrected with an enlargement procedure.
Precautions
A woman in poor health or with a severe chronic
disease is not a good candidate for this procedure.
Description
A cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa-
tient procedure. It may be done under local or general
anesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer-
ence. The incision is made through the armpit, under the
breast, or around the areola (the darkened area around
the nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu-
ous scars. The implant is placed between the breast tissue
and underlying chest muscle, or under the chest muscle.
The operation takes approximately one to two hours. The
cost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insur-

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 585  ance. However, if enlargement is part of breast recon-
struction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay for
some or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-
$4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breast
augmentation or augmentation mammaplasty.
Preparation
Before the surgery is performed, the woman should
have a clear understanding of what her new breasts will
look like. She and her physician should agree about the
desired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to have
the patient review before and after pictures, to clarify
expectations.
Aftercare
Driving and normal activities may be restricted for
up to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to
10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,
including vigorous exercise, in about three weeks. The
scars will be red for approximately one month, but will
fade to their final appearance within one or two years.
Risks
Risks which are common to any surgical procedure
include bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-
pected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result in
decreased sensation in the breast, or interference with
breast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficult
to read and interpret mammograms, possibly delaying
breast cancerdetection. Also, the implant itself can rup-
ture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor-
mally forms around the implant, called a capsule, can
become very hard. This is called capsular contracture,
and may result in painand/or an altered appearance of
the breast. The older the implant, the greater the chances
that these problems will occur.
There has been intermittent publicity about possible
health risks from breast implants. Most concerns have
focused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use of
this type of implant, and ordered further studies. Today
only saline-filled implants are used for cosmetic breast
surgery. Recent studies have shown no evidence long-
term health risks from silicone implants. However,
research on the possible links between these implants and
autoimmune or connective tissue diseases is continuing.
Normal results
Breasts of expected size and appearance would be
the normal results of this surgery.

Breast reconstruction
Definition
Breast reconstruction is a series of surgical proce-
dures performed to recreate a breast. Reconstructions are
commonly done after one or both breasts are removed as
a treatment for breast cancer. Also, a breast may need to
be refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma or
abnormalities that occur during breast development.
Purpose
Many authorities consider reconstruction an integral
part of the therapy for breast cancer. A breast that
appears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normal-
cy, which can aid in the psychological recovery from
breast cancer. It eliminates the need for an external pros-
thesis (false breast), which many women find physically
uncomfortable as well as inconvenient.
Precautions
Not all women are good candidates for breast recon-
struction. Overall poor physical health, or specific prob-
lems such as cigarette smoking,obesity, high blood
pressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of compli-
cations. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged recovery peri-
od or failure of the reconstruction may be a result. A
woman’s physical ability to cope with major surgery and
recuperation also need to be considered.
Description
Breast reconstruction is done in two stages, with the
ultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and feels
as natural as possible. It is important to remember that
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2586
Breast reconstruction
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 586  while a good result may mimic a normal breast closely,
there will inevitably be scars and loss of sensation. The
reconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original.
The first step is to form a structure called a breast
mound. This can be accomplished using artificial materials
called breast implants, or by using tissues from other parts
of the woman’s body. The second step involves creating a
balance between the newly constructed breast and the
breast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex
(darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual-
ly done several months after the mound is created, to allow
swelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary,
such as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or making
it larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.
Timing, immediate or delayed reconstruction
While immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom-
mended for women with breast cancer who need to under-
go other, more important treatments, breast reconstruction
can be done almost anytime. It even can be done during the
same procedure as the mastectomy, or it can be delayed.
There are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to return
to normal activities and routines is often enhanced when
reconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. A
better appearance may result from IR. There is less skin
removal, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is
better able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast,
so it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely.
The cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of
delayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-
tion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for a
combined procedure than for two separate surgeries.
There are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery
itself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.
Post-operative painand recovery time will be greater
than for mastectomy alone.
Other authorities contend that delayed reconstruc-
tion (DR) offers different physical and psychological
advantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alone
takes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and less
pain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more time
to adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additional
therapy. She is better able to research her options, and to
formulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon-
structive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR,
the patient can donate her own blood ahead of time
(autologous transfusion), and/or arrange to have family
and friends donate blood for her use (directed donation).
The psychological stressof living without a breast is
a disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entails
results in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster,
an additional recuperation period is required after the
delayed operation.
Type of reconstruction
There are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-
tion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant or
the breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis-
sues (autologous reconstruction).
ARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS.In general, implant proce-
dures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo-
gous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They are
made of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth or
textured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (salt
water), or a combination of both.
An implant may be a fixed volume type, which can-
not change its size. Implants that have the capacity to be
filled after insertion are called tissue expanders. These
may be temporary or permanent.
The initial procedure for any implant insertion uses
the mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu-
ally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas-
tectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose,
or a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant is
inserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as needed
and stitched closed.
If there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size,
or a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander is
used. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with an
attached valve or port through which saline can be injected.
After the initial surgical incision is healed, the woman
returns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weekly
basis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injections
can continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferred
size is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and later
partially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result.
A temporary tissue expander will be removed after several
months and replaced with a permanent implant.
IR surgery using an implant takes approximately
two to three hours, and usually requires up to a three day
hospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR,
takes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as an
outpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization.
AUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap and
free flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissue
is used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus-
cle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi-
nal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon-
struction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour-
ishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. The
second kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also uses
skin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and

Breast reconstruction
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 587  attaches them to other vessels where the new breast is to
be created. The surgeon uses a microscope to accomplish
this delicate task of sewing blood vessels together. Some-
times the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flap
procedures. Either type of surgery may also be called a
myocutaneous flap, referring to the skin and muscle used.
The skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc-
tion can come from one of several possible places on the
body, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or “tummy
tuck”), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the buttocks
(gluteus maximus free flap).
Finishing the reconstruction
Other procedures may be necessary to achieve the goal
of symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to make the
opposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction),
or higher (mastopexy). These, or any other refinements
should be completed before the creation of a nipple and
areola. Tissue to form the new nipple may come from the
reconstructed breast itself, the opposite breast, or a more
distant donor site, such as the inner thigh or behind the ear.
The nipple and areolar construction is usually an outpatient
procedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, is
tattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the color of
the opposite nipple and areola as closely as possible.
Insurance
Insurance coverage for breast reconstruction varies
widely. Some policies will allow procedures on the affect-
ed breast, but refuse to pay for alterations to the opposite

Latissimus dorsi procedure
TRAM flap procedure
Breast reconstruction surgery may be performed by inserting an artificial substance, or implant, to replace breast tissue.
Autologous reconstruction, in which a woman’s own tissues are used, includes the latissimus dorsi flap, where skin and
muscle taken from the back is rotated around to the breast area, and the TRAM flap, in which abdominal fat and muscle are
tunneled under the skin to the breast area.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 588  breast. Other plans may cover the cost of an external pros-
thesis, or reconstructive surgery, but not both. As of Janu-
ary 1998, 25 states had different laws regarding required
insurance coverage for post mastectomy reconstruction.
Implants may pose additional insurance concerns.
Some companies will withdraw coverage for women
with implants, or add a disclaimer for future implant-
related problems. Careful reading of insurance policies,
including checking on the need for pre-approval and/or a
second opinion, is strongly recommended.
Preparation
Routine preoperative preparations, such as taking
nothing to eat or drink the night before surgery are need-
ed for reconstructive procedures. Blood transfusions are
often necessary for autologous reconstructive surgeries.
The patient may donate her own blood, and/or have fami-
ly and friends donate several weeks before the surgery.
Emotional preparation is also important. Breast
reconstruction will not resolve a psychological problem
the woman had before mastectomy, nor make an unstable
relationship strong. An expectation of physical perfection
is unrealistic. A woman who cites any of these reasons
for reconstruction shows that she has not been adequate-
ly informed or prepared. Complete understanding of the
benefits and limitations of this surgery is necessary for a
satisfactory result.
Aftercare
The length of the hospital stay, recovery period, and
frequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies consid-
erably with the different kinds of reconstruction. In general,
autologous procedures require longer hospitalization and
recovery time than implant procedures. Bandages and
drainage tubes remain in place for at least a day for all surg-
eries. Microsurgical or free flaps are most closely moni-
tored in the first day or two after surgery. The circulation to
the breast may be checked as often as every hour. Complete
breast reconstruction requires at least one additional
surgery to create a nipple and areola. Scars may remain red
and raised for a month or longer. The true, final appearance
of the breasts will not be visible for at least one year.
Risks
Some women have reported various types of autoim-
mune related connective-tissue disorders, which they
attribute to their implants usually involving silicone gel
implants. Lawsuits have been filed against the manufac-
turers of implants. Food and Drug Administration guide-
lines, issued in 1992, now limit their use to women who
need to replace an existing silicone gel-filled implant,
KEY TERMS
Autologous—From the same person. An autolo-

comfort and/or firmness.

have had surgery for breast cancer, or have a medical
condition which results in serious breast abnormality. In
addition, patients must sign a consent form which details
the potential risks of silicone gel-filled implants, and
become enrolled in a long range study. Saline filled
implants are permitted for all uses, although manufactur-
ers must collect data on possible risks.
The FDA issued a status report on Breast Implant
Safety in 1995, and revised it in March 1997. It noted
that studies so far have not shown a serious increase in
the risk of recognized autoimmune diseases in women
with silicone gel-filled breast implants. It also addressed
concerns about other complications and emphasized the
need for further study of this issue.
There are a number of risks common to any surgical
procedure such as bleeding, infection, anesthesia reac-
tion, or unexpected scarring. Hematoma (accumulation
of blood at the surgical site), or seroma (collection of
fluid at the surgical site) can delay healing if not drained.
Any breast reconstruction also poses a risk of asymmetry
and/or the need for unplanned surgical revision. Persis-
tent pain is another potential complication possible with
all types of breast reconstruction.
Implants have some unique problems that may
develop. A thick scar, also called a capsule, forms around
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	589
Breast reconstruction
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 589  the implant, as part of the body’s normal reaction to a
foreign substance. Capsular contracture occurs when the
scar becomes firm or hardened. This may cause pain
and/or change the texture and appearance of the breast.
Implants can rupture and leak, deflate, or become dis-
placed. The chances of capsular contracture or rupture
increase with the age of the implant. These complica-
tions can usually be remedied with outpatient surgery to
loosen the capsule or remove and/or replace the implant
as needed. There is some evidence that using implants
with textured surfaces may decrease the incidence of
these problems. An implant tends to remain firm indefi-
nitely. It will not grow larger or smaller as the woman’s
weight changes. Asymmetry can develop if a woman
gains or loses a large amount of weight.
The autologous procedures all carry a risk of flap
failure—loss of blood supply to the tissue forming the
new breast. If a large portion of the flap develops inade-
quate blood supply, another reconstructive technique
may be necessary. TRAM flap procedures can result in
decreased muscle tone and weakness in the abdomen
and/or abdominal hernia. Arm weakness may occur after
latissimus dorsi flap surgery.
Normal results
A normal result of breast reconstruction depends on
the woman’s goals and expectations. It will not be the
same as the breast it replaces. In general, it should be sim-
ilar in size and shape to the opposite breast, but will have
less sensation and be less mobile than a natural breast. A
reconstruction using implants will usually be firmer and
rounder than the other breast. It may feel cooler to touch,
depending on the amount of tissue over it. Scars are
unavoidable, but should be as unobtrusive as possible.

Breast reduction
Definition
Breast reduction is a surgical procedure performed
in order to decrease the size of the breasts.
Purpose
Women with very large breasts (macromastia or
mammary hyperplasia) seek breast reduction for relief of
painin the back, shoulder, and neck. They may also feel
uncomfortable about their breast size and have difficulty
finding clothing that will fit properly. Additionally, breast
reduction may be needed after reconstructive surgery fol-
lowing the surgical removal of cancerous breast tissue
(mastectomy), to make the breasts more symmetric.
Men who have enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) may
also be candidates for breast reduction. However, excessive
alcohol intake,smoking marijuana, or using anabolic
steroids may cause gynecomastia, and surgery is not rec-
ommended for men who continue to use these products.
Precautions
Breast reduction is not recommended for women
whose breasts are not fully developed or who plan to
breast feed.
Description
Breast reduction may also be called reduction
mammaplasty. It is most often done in the hospital, under
general anesthetic. However, studies have suggested that
an outpatient procedure, using local anesthetic and mild
sedationmay be appropriate for some patients. The
operation takes approximately two to four hours. The
most commonly made incision encircles the areola (dark-
ened area around the nipple) and extends downward and
around the underside of the breast. This produces the
least conspicuous scar. The excess tissue, fat, and skin
are removed, and the nipple and areola are repositioned.
In certain cases,liposuction(fat suctioning) is used to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2590
Breast reduction
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 590  remove extra fat from the armpit area. A hospital stay of
up to three days may be needed for recovery.
If deemed medically necessary, breast reduction is
covered by some insurance plans. However, a specified
amount of breast tissue may need to be removed in order
to qualify for coverage. Surgeon’s fees range from
$4,800-$6,500 and up.
Preparation
Consultation between surgeon and patient is impor-
tant to ensure that the woman understands and agrees
with the expected final results of the procedure. Mea-
surements and photographs may be taken. Many doctors
also recommend a mammogram before the operation, to
make sure there is no cancer.
Aftercare
After the surgery, an elastic bandage or special support-
ive bra is placed over gauze bandages and drainage tubes.
The bandages and tubes are removed in a day or two. The
bra will need to be worn around the clock for several weeks.
Stitches are removed one to three weeks after the operation.
Normal activities, including sexual relations may be restrict-
ed for several weeks. Scars will typically remain red, and
perhaps lumpy for up to several months, but will gradually
fade and become less noticeable. It may take up to a year
before the breasts achieve their final position and size.
Risks
Risks common to any operation include bleeding,
infection, anesthesia reactions, or unexpected scarring.
Breast reduction may result in decreased feeling in the
breasts or nipples and/or impaired ability to breastfeed.
When healing is complete, the breasts may be slightly
uneven, or the nipples may be asymmetric.
Normal results
Smaller breast size should be achieved, and with
that, the accompanying pain and discomfort should be
alleviated.
KEY TERMS
Gynecomastia—Overly developed or enlarged
breasts in a male.
Macromastia—Excessive size of the breasts.
Mammary hyperplasia—Increased size of the
breast.

Breast self-examination
Definition
A breast self-examination (BSE) is an inspection by
a woman of her breasts to detect breast cancer.
Purpose
A BSE is one of three tests the American Cancer
Society recommends to help detect breast cancer in its
earliest stages. By regularly examining her own breasts, a
woman is more likely to find any changes that may have
occurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a week
after a woman’s period ends, when her breasts are not ten-
der or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSE
should be completed on the same day every month. A
BSE should also be regularly completed by women who
are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants. By
combining a BSE with a mammographyand clinical
breast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu-
nity for reducing chances of deathfrom breast cancer
through early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancers
are found through a BSE. The American Cancer Society
recommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com-
plete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anything
suspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully in
a mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling,
puckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple.
Description
To complete a monthly BSE:
• When lying down, place a pillow under the right shoul-
der and position the right arm behind the head. Using
the finger pads of the three middle fingers on the left
hand, check the entire breast area. Use small circles and
follow an up-and-down pattern while pressing firmly
enough to know how the breast feels from month to
month. This exam should then be repeated on the left

Breast self-examination
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 591  breast using the finger pads of the right hand with the
pillow under the left shoulder.
• When standing before a mirror, any changes in the
shape or look of the breasts should be checked. In order
to look for any skin or nipple changes such as dimpling
or nipple discharge, the arms should first be placed at
the sides and then overhead. Hands are then placed
firmly on hips to flex chest muscles, and then the body
should be bent forward.
• When taking a shower, the right arm should be raised.
By using soapy hands and fingers flat the right breast
and outer part of the breast can be examined. The same
small circles and up-and-down pattern used when lying
down should be used in an upright position. Repeat on
the left breast.
Preparation
Before beginning a monthly BSE, a woman’s breasts
should be completely exposed.
Normal results
Each woman’s breasts has their own normal look
and feel. By completing a BSE each month, a woman can
determine what is normal for her and check for changes
that may arise. A regular pattern of lumpiness in the
breasts is normal.
Abnormal results
If any changes are noticed during a monthly BSE,
such as a new, hard lump in the breast or underarms, a
doctor should examine the area immediately. Other trou-
ble signs that should not be ignored include:
• change in breast size or shape
• dimpling or puckering of the skin
• redness, swelling, or warmth that does not go away
•a painin one area that does not vary with a woman’s
monthly cycle
• a nipple that pulls in
• discharge from the nipple that begins suddenly and
appears only in one breast
• one nipple that has an itchy, sore, or scaling area

Breast sonogram seeBreast ultrasound
Breast ultrasound
Definition
Breast ultrasound (or sonography) is an imaging
technique for diagnosing breast disease, such as cancer.
It uses harmless, high frequency sound waves to form an
image (sonogram). The sound waves pass through the
breast and bounce back or echo from various tissues to
form a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasive
and involves no radiation.
Purpose
Breast ultrasound may be used in several ways. The
most common application is to investigate a specific area
of the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpable
lump and/or a lump or density discovered by x ray
(mammogram) can be further evaluated by ultrasound. It
is especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid-
filled cyst and a solid mass. It can also identify small
lesions that are too tiny to be felt.
Breast ultrasound is often the first study performed to
evaluate masses in women under 35 whose mammograms
can be difficult to interpret due to the density of their
breast tissue. The lack of radiation used with ultrasound
makes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in women
who are pregnant. Assessing breast implantsfor leakage
or rupture is another way ultrasound is used. Breast
inflammation, where pockets of infection or abscesses
may form, can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound.
Thickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign of
inflammatory breast cancer. Ultrasound can sometimes
identify a cancerous growth within the breast causing the
thickened skin. These cases are usually followed by a
core biopsy guided by ultrasound (described below).
Breast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide a
needle for several interventional procedures. These include
cyst aspiration, fine needle aspiration, large core needle
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2592
Breast ultrasound
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 592  biopsy (as a first step in determining treatment for a lesion
that is likely to be cancerous), and needle localization in
surgical breast biopsy. Biopsies guided by ultrasound have
distinct advantages. The ultrasound guides the needle so
that a lesion can be removed for the biopsy. Patients usually
find that the procedure is less traumatic and more comfort-
able than surgical biopsies. Ultrasound is known for its
accuracy in determining how far a cancerous growth
extends into the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot be
felt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less costly
than surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the abnormality that
requires biopsy can be seen on both a mammogram and
ultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is often more
comfortable for the patient as no compression is necessary.
Description
Ultrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or anoth-
er outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center.
The patient removes her clothing from the waist up
and puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She lies
on her back or side on an examining table. A gel that
enhances sound transmission is spread over the area to be
examined. The technologist then places a transducer, an
instrument about the size of an electric shaver, against
the skin. The images from reflected sound waves appear
on a monitor screen.
A good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if the
patient is unable to remain quietly in one position. Obe-
sitymay hinder clear viewing of internal structures, and
the accuracy of an ultrasound study is highly dependent
on the skill of the person performing the examination.
The images recorded vary with the angle and pressure of
the transducer and the equipment settings. The examina-
tion may take from 30 to 45 minutes. Most insurance
plans cover the cost of an ultrasound examination.
Normal results
An ultrasound examination may reveal either normal
tissue or a benign condition such as a cyst. Ultrasound
can confidently diagnose a benign structure that has cer-
tain characteristics of a simple cyst. In the case of a sim-
ple cyst with no symptoms, additional treatment beyond
continued observation is usually not needed.
Abnormal results
A potentially malignant mass can be identified by
breast ultrasound. Abnormal results fall into the following

KEY TERMS
Cyst—A thin-walled, fluid-filled benign structure
in the breast.
Ductal carcinoma—A type of cancer that
accounts for as much as 80% of breast cancers.
These tumors feel bigger than they look on ultra-
sound or mammogram.
Fibroadenoma—A benign breast growth made up
of fibrous tissue. It is the most common mass in
women under 35 years of age, and is found in
both breasts in 3% of cases.
Infiltrating lobular carcinoma—A type of cancer
that accounts for 8% to 10% of breast cancers. In
breasts that are especially dense, ultrasound can
be useful in identifying these masses.
Microcalcifications—Tiny flecks that are too small
to be felt. They are important markers of cancer
that show up on ultrasound and mammogram.
Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma—A type of cancer
that accounts for 1% to 2% of breast cancers.
Resembles medullary carcinoma in ultrasound and
mammogram, but usually affects older women.
Nonpalpable—Cannot be felt by hand. In cancer,
growths that are nonpalpable are too small to be
felt, but may be seen on ultrasound or mammo-
gram.
Papillary carcinoma—A type of breast cancer that
primarily occurs in older women. On ultrasound,
this type of tumor may look like a solid or com-
plex mass, or it may show up as solid tissue pro-
truding into a cyst.
Tubular carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts
for approximately 1% to 2% of breast cancers. Can
appear small on ultrasound or mammogram.
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 593  categories: benign fibrous nodule, complex cyst, suspi-
cious lesion, and lesion highly suggestive of cancer. In
cases where ultrasound shows the presence of a complex
cyst or fibrous nodule, a biopsy is justified because 10% to
15% of these growths are malignant. Lesions falling into
the last two categories (suspicious or highly suggestive of
cancer) have a higher chance of being cancerous, and
should be investigated further, either by biopsy or surgery.
Breast cancers such as the following may be identified
on ultrasound: ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carci-
noma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous (colloid) carcino-
ma, tubular carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. On ultra-
sound, the shape of a lesion and the type of edges it has can
sometimes indicate if it is benign or cancerous, but there
are exceptions. For example, benign fibroadenomas are
usually oval, and some cancers can be similarly shaped.
Cancerous tumors usually have jagged edges, but some
benign growths can have these edges as well. Ultrasound is
not a definitive test. Tissue diagnosis is often required.

Breech birth
Definition
Breech birth is the delivery of a fetus (unborn baby)
hind end first. Between 3-4% of fetuses will start labor in the
breech position, which is a potentially dangerous situation.
Description
Throughout most of pregnancy, the developing
fetus is completely free to move around within the
uterus. Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large that
movement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus to
turn over, so whatever position it has assumed by this
point is likely to be the same position that he or she will
be in when labor begins.
For reasons that are not fully understood, almost all
unborn babies settle into a head down position. The fetus
is upside down in the uterus, and the head will lead the
way during the birth process.
Unfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate. Most
of these are in the breech position. The buttocks lead the
way out of the uterus, and the legs are folded in front of
the body (frank breech). Delivery from the breech posi-
tion poses far more risks than delivery head first (vertex
position).
The biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its
head. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, then
the rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily. If
the fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that the body
will fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the baby’s head
will get stuck at the level of the chin. This condition,
known as a trapped head, is very dangerous.
When the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance to
“mold” during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull are
not yet fastened together the way they are in a child or
adult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s skull
can move. During the long hours of labor the skull can
change shape to fit through the pelvis more easily, which
is why many babies are born with a “cone head”. If the
baby is born from the breech position, the skull does not
have a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis, and it is
even more likely to get stuck.
If the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of
injury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilical
cord usually stops pulsating (just as it would during a nor-
mal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen supply from the
mother to the baby. If the baby’s head is still inside the
uterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own. Therefore,
it is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible.
The life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head
can cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting in
permanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby can-
not be delivered within a few minutes, the baby might
die. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech delivery
with a trapped head.
Of course, many babies are safely delivered from the
breech position. There are certain factors that make a
breech delivery more likely to be successful: if ultra-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2594
Breech birth
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 594  sound (a technique that uses sound waves to visualize the
fetus) shows that the fetus is in the frank breech position,
the fetus’s head is tucked on its chest, and the fetus is not
big, it is less likely that its head will get stuck.
Among breech babies born after the full nine-month
term, smaller babies usually do better. This is not true for
premature babies. Premature babies are more likely to have
a trapped head because the body of a premature baby is
usually much smaller than his or her head. Premature
babies are generally not delivered from the breech position.
The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by
delivering the baby through a surgical procedure (cesarean
section, also known as c-section). For the past twenty
years, cesarean section has been recommended when the
fetus is breech. More recently, many providers have offered
the option of version, attempting to turn the fetus within the
uterus to a head first position before labor begins.
Version is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in
the breech position does a somersault, it will end up head
down. During a version, the obstetrician tries to make the
fetus do a somersault.
A version should only be done in a hospital, with an
ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician in
turning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with a
fetal monitor before and after the version. Some obstetri-
cians give the mother an injection of medication to relax
the mother’s uterus and prevent any contractions.
During the procedure, the obstetrician places his or
her hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the location of
the unborn baby’s buttocks and head. The buttocks are
lifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the baby’s
head to encourage him to perform a somersault. It may
take several tries before the fetus cooperates, but over
half will eventually turn.
A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in
the breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can only be
tried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is not
lying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord does
not appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of breech birth is not known. There are
generally no identifiable symptoms. However, some
women can tell the position of the fetus by where they
feel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell what
position the fetus is in at any given moment.
Diagnosis
A health care provider can often tell the position of
the fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mother’s
abdomen. Another clue to the position is the location
where the heartbeat is heard best. If the fetus’s heartbeat
is best heard below the level of the mother’s navel, it is
likely to be positioned head first. On the other hand, if
the heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel, it
is likely to be breech.
The only way to really be sure, however, is to do an
ultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very easy to
tell the position of the fetus.
Treatment
If a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks of
pregnancy, there are three possible courses of action: Cesare-
an section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery.
Cesarean section is the most common way to deliver
a breech baby. This surgical procedure carries more risk
for the mother, but many women prefer to take the risk of
surgery on themselves rather than let the baby face the
risks of breech delivery.
Version is gaining in popularity. Version is a medical
procedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn the
breech fetus to the head first position. Version is success-
ful more than 50% of the time. However, some babies
who are successfully turned will turn back to the breech
position after the procedure is done.

Breech Birth
Approximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech
(buttocks first) position. While this is a potentially danger-
ous situation, many full-term babies can be safely delivered
from the breech position.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators
Group.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 595  Some women choose breech vaginal delivery. This
should only be attempted if ultrasound shows that the
fetus is in a favorable breech position. Most babies will
do very well during a breech delivery, but it is always
possible that the fetus will be injured, perhaps seriously.
Prevention
There is no way to prevent a fetus from settling into
the breech position at the end of pregnancy. A woman
who has had one breech fetus is more likely than average
to have another.

Bronchiectasis
Definition
Bronchiectasis is a condition in which an area of the
bronchial tubes is permanently and abnormally widened
(dilated), with accompanying infection.
Description
The bronchial tubes are the networks of branching
tubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs (alve-
oli). In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi is
unusually large. Examination of the walls of the bronchial
tubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements,
with replacement by scar tissue. Pus collects within the
bronchi, and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs, and
carbon dioxide out of the lungs (air exchange) is impaired.
The bronchi show signs of inflammation, with swelling
and invasion by a variety of immune cells. The inflamed
areas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels. The
area of the lung which should be served by a diseased
bronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infection.
Causes and symptoms
Prior to the widespread use of immunizations,
bronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infection
with either measlesor whooping cough. Currently,
viruses that cause influenza(flu) or influenza-like syn-
dromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede the
development of bronchiectasis. Patients who have been
infected with tuberculosisor the virus which causes
AIDS(HIV or human immunodeficiencyvirus) also
have an increased chance of bronchiectasis.
A number of pre-existing conditions may cause an
individual to be more susceptible than normal to infec-
tion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.
These conditions include disorders of cilia, and immune
disorders.
Cilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the
bronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping the
bronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders, and
cleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum) which
may be produced by the bronchi. When these cilia are
abnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial or viral
invaders may remain in the respiratory tract, multiply,
and cause serious infections.
Immune disorders include decreased production of
certain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins) which
usually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viral
invasion. When these immunoglobulins are not produced
in large enough quantity, bacterial and viral invaders are
not effectively killed off, and infection occurs.
Other causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal-
ly blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to tumor
growth within the bronchial tube, or due to a child acci-
dentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off the
bronchial tube. People with the disease called cystic
fibrosis(CF) often have their bronchial tubes obstructed
by the thick, sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CF.
Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) can
harm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis. An extreme
allergic response of the immune system to the presence
of certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus) can
also damage the bronchial tubes enough to result in
bronchiectasis.
Symptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough
and the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mix-
ture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In some
cases, there may be wheezingand shortness of breath.
The constant, low-level of infection may flare, resulting
in increased production of sputum, worsening of the
cough, and fever. The area of the lung served by the
affected bronchial tube may become severely infected,
resulting in pneumonia.

Bronchiectasis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 596  Diagnosis
Chest x raymay reveal evidence of bronchiectasis,
and CT scans are particularly good at revealing the thick,
dilated bronchial walls of bronchiectasis. Sputum will
need to be collected and cultured (grown in a laboratory
dish), in order to examine it microscopically for the spe-
cific type of organism responsible for infection. A careful
search for other underlying diseases is important, look-
ing in particular for ciliary abnormalities, cystic fibrosis,
or immunoglobulin deficiencies.
Treatment
Treatment should involve efforts to resolve any
underlying disorder. Infections will require antibiotics,
obstruction may require the removal of a foreign object or
tumor. Medications are available to help thin the sputum,
so that it can be more effectively coughed up. Rhythmic
clapping on the chest and back, while the patient assumes
a number of positions (head down, primarily), may help
the lungs to drain more effectively. This is called chest
physical therapy, or percussion and postural drainage.
When a particular area of the lung is constantly and
severely infected, surgery may be needed to remove it. When
bleeding occurs from irritated bronchial tubes and over-
grown bronchial blood vessels, surgery may be required
either to remove an area of the bronchial tube, or to inject the
bleeding blood vessel with a material to stop the bleeding.
In some patients, bronchiectasis eventually leads to a
constantly low level of blood oxygen, despite other treat-
ments. These patients usually have an associated increase
in the size of the right side of their hearts, along with a
decrease in the heart’s ability to pump blood through the
lungs. Some patients with extremely severe symptoms and
disability have been treated with lung transplantation.
Prognosis
Prognosis varies widely, depending on how wide-
spread or focal the bronchiectasis, and the presence of
other underlying disorders.

KEY TERMS
Bronchi—The network of tubular passages which
carry air to the lung and allow air to be expelled
from the lungs.
Cilia—Hair-like projections which line the
bronchial tubes (also present in other areas of the
body). Normal cilia beat consistently, sweeping
the bronchi clean of bacteria, viruses, and mucus.
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 597  trachea and the larger air tubes of the lung that bring air in
from the trachea (bronchi). Bronchitis can either be of
brief duration (acute) or have a long course (chronic).
Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, but
can also be caused by a bacterial infection and can heal
without complications. Chronic bronchitis is a sign of seri-
ous lung disease that may be slowed but cannot be cured.
Description
Although acute and chronic bronchitis are both
inflammations of the air passages, their causes and treat-
ments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent in
winter. It usually follows a viral infection, such as a cold
or the flu, and can be accompanied by a secondary bacter-
ial infection. Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeks,
although the coughmay persist longer. Acute bronchitis,
like any upper airway inflammatory process, can increase
a person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia.
Anyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, young
children, and the elderly are more likely to get the dis-
ease because people in these age groups generally have
weaker immune systems. Smokers and people with heart
or other lung diseases are also at higher risk of develop-
ing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed to chemical
fumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greater
chance of developing acute bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability and
deathin the United States. The American Lung Associa-
tion estimates that about 14 million Americans suffer
from the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic bronchi-
tis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by cough-
ing and spitting up of phlegm. In chronic bronchitis,
these symptoms are present for at least three months in
each of two consecutive years.
Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial
irritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently, more
men than women developed chronic bronchitis, but as
the number of women who smoke has increased, so has
their rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease pro-
gresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are more
likely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that
fall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD). Other diseases in this category include
emphysemaand chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronic
bronchitis may progress to emphysema, or both diseases
may be present together.
Causes and symptoms
Acute bronchitis
Acute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms
of a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and dry cough.
However, the cough soon becomes deep and painful.
Coughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum.
These symptoms may be accompanied by a feverof up
to 102°F (38.8°C). Wheezingafter coughing is common.
In uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and
most other symptoms, except the cough, disappear after
three to five days. Coughing may continue for several
weeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacter-
ial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel-
ing of illness persist. To be cured, the bacterial infection
should be treated with antibiotics.
Chronic bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory
tract irritants. The most common irritant is cigarette
smoke. The American Lung Association estimates that
80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking. Other
irritants include chemical fumes, air pollution, and envi-
ronmental irritants, such as mold or dust.
Chronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The
cells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair-
like outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally, the
cilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucus
along the airways. When smoke or other irritants are
inhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap off. When
this occurs, the cilia are no longer able to move mucus,
and the airways become inflamed, narrowed, and
clogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and can
progress to the life-threatening disease emphysema.
A mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is
usually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.
Coughing brings up phlegm, although the amount varies
considerably from person to person. Wheezing and
shortness of breathmay accompany the cough. Diag-
nostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As the dis-
ease advances, breathing becomes difficult and activity
decreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, lead-
ing to changes in the composition of the blood.
Diagnosis
Initial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing
the patient’s symptoms and health history. The physician
will listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope for
specific sounds that indicate lung inflammation, such as
moist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that indicates
airway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling sound heard
with a stethoscope that is caused by fluid secretion in the
bronchial tubes.
A sputum culturemay be performed, particularly if
the sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine whether
a bacterial infection is present and to identify the disease-

selected. Normally, the patient will be asked to cough
deeply, then spit the material that comes up from the lungs
(sputum) into a cup. This sample is then grown in the labo-
ratory to determine which organisms are present. The
results are available in two to three days, except for tests for
tuberculosis, which can take as long as two months.
Occasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder,
the sample of sputum is collected using a procedure
called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, the patient is
given a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed into the air-
ways to collect a sputum sample.
A pulmonary function testis important in diagnos-
ing chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.
This test uses an instrument called a spirometer to mea-
sure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs.
The test is done in the doctor’s office and is painless. It
involves breathing into the spirometer mouthpiece either
normally or forcefully. Volumes less than 80% of the
normal values indicate an obstructive lung disease.
To better determine what type of obstructive lung
disease a patient has, the doctor may do a chest x ray,
electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electrocar-
diogram is an instrument that is used to measure the elec-
trical activity of the heart and is useful in the diagnosis of
heart conditions. Other tests may be used to measure how
effectively oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in
the lungs.
Treatment
Acute bronchitis
When no secondary infection is present, acute bron-
chitis is treated in the same way as the common cold.
Home care includes drinking plenty of fluids, resting, not
smoking, increasing moisture in the air with a cool mist
humidifier, and taking acetaminophen(Datril, Tylenol,
Panadol) for fever and pain. Aspirinshould not be given
to children because of its association with the serious ill-
ness,Reye’s syndrome.
Cough suppressantsare used only when the cough
is dry and produces no sputum. If the patient is coughing
up phlegm, the cough should be allowed to continue. The
purpose of the cough it to bring up extra mucus and irri-
tants from the lungs. When coughing is suppressed, the
mucus accumulates in the plugged airways and can
become a breeding ground for pneumonia bacteria.
Expectorant cough medicines, unlike cough suppres-
sants, do not stop the cough. Instead they are used to thin
the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. This
type of cough medicine may be helpful to individuals suf-
fering from bronchitis. People who are unsure about what

If a secondary bacterial infection is present, the

take the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed. Stopping
the antibiotic early can lead to a return of the infection.
Tetracycline or ampicillin are often used to treat adults.
Other possibilities include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxa-
zole (Bactrim or Septra) and the newer erythromycin-
like drugs, such as azithromycin (Zithromax) and clar-
ithromycin (Biaxin). Children under age eight are usual-
ly given amoxicillin (Amoxil, Pentamox, Sumox, Tri-
mox), because tetracycline discolors permanent teeth that
have not yet come in.
Chronic bronchitis
The treatment of chronic bronchitis is complex and
depends on the stage of chronic bronchitis and whether
other health problems are present. Lifestyle changes, such
as quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke or
polluted air, are an important first step. Controlled exer-
cise performed on a regular basis is also important.
Drug therapy begins with bronchodilators. These
drugs relax the muscles of the bronchial tubes and allow
increased air flow. They can be taken by mouth or
inhaled using a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a device that
delivers a regulated flow of medication into the airways.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	599
Bronchitis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 599  Common bronchodilators include albuterol (Ventolin,
Proventil, Apo-Salvent) and metaproterenol (Alupent,
Orciprenaline, Metaprel, Dey-Dose).
Anti-inflammatory medications are added to reduce
swelling of the airway tissue. Corticosteroids, such as
prednisone, can be taken orally or intravenously. Other
steroids are inhaled. Long-term steroid use can have seri-
ous side effects. Other drugs, such as ipratropium (Atro-
vent), are given to reduce the quantity of mucus produced.
As the disease progresses, the patient may need sup-
plemental oxygen. Complications of COPD are many
and often require hospitalization in the latter stages of the
disease.
Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners focus on prevention by eat-
ing a healthy diet that strengthens the immune system and
practicing stressmanagement. Bronchitis can become
serious if it progresses to pneumonia, therefore, antibi-
otics may be required. In addition, however, there are a
multitude of botanical and herbal medicines that can be
formulated to treat bronchitis. Some examples include
inhaling eucalyptus or other essential oils in warm steam.
Herbalists recommend a tea made of mullein (Verbascum
thapsus), coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), and anise seed
(Pimpinella anisum). Homeopathic medicine and tradi-
tional Chinese medicinemay also be very useful for
bronchitis, and hydrotherapycan contribute to cleaning
the chest and stimulating immune response.
Prognosis
When treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves in
one to two weeks without complications, although a
cough may continue for several more weeks. The pro-
gression of chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, may be
slowed, and an initial improvement in symptoms may be
achieved. Unfortunately, however, there is no cure for
chronic bronchitis, and the disease can often lead to or
coexist with emphysema. Taken together, all forms of
COPD are a leading cause of death.
Prevention
The best way to prevent bronchitis is not to begin
smoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are ten times more
likely to die of COPD than non-smokers. Smokers who
stop show improvement in lung function. Other preventa-
tive steps include avoiding chemical and environmental
irritants, such as air pollution, and maintaining good
overall health. Immunizations against certain types of
pneumonia (as well as influenza) are an important pre-
ventative measure for anyone with lung or immune sys-
tem diseases.

Bronchodilators
Definition
Bronchodilators are medicines that help open the
bronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs, allowing more air
to flow through them.
Purpose
People with asthmahave trouble breathing, because
their airways are inflamed and become narrowed. Nor-
mally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and nose
through the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungs
as a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happens
automatically when the person stops breathing in. In a
person with asthma, breathing in (inhaling) is not a prob-
lem. Incoming air can slide around the blockage, because
the act of breathing in makes the airways expand. The
problem comes when the person with asthma tries to
breathe out. The air can no longer get past the blockage,
and it remains trapped in the lungs. The person can then
only take shallow breaths. Bronchodilators work by
relaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways. This
makes the airways open wider and allows air to leave the
lungs. These drugs also are used to relieve breathing
problems associated with emphysema, chronic bronchi-
tis, and other lung diseases.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2600
Bronchodilators
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 600  Description
Some bronchodilators are inhaled, using a nebulizer
or an inhalation aerosol. Others are taken as injections or
by mouth. Most are available only by prescription, but a
few, such as ephedrine, can be bought without a physi-
cian’s prescription. Examples of bronchodilators are
albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), epinephrine (Primatene),
ipratropium (Atrovent), metaproterenol (Alupent,
Metaprel), and terbutaline (Brethine).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
bronchodilator and may be different for different
patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the
drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the
correct dosage.
Precautions
Bronchodilators come with patient instructions. Be
sure to carefully read them before using the medicine. If
there is any confusion about how to use the medicine,
check with the physician or pharmacist. Always use these
medicines exactly as directed. Taking larger than recom-
mended doses or using the medicine too often can lead to
serious side effects and even death.
If symptoms do not improve or if they get worse
after using a bronchodilator, call a physician right away.
Although some bronchodilators are available with-
out a physician’s prescription, these medicines should
not be used unless a physician has diagnosed the
patient’s condition as asthma.
Some asthma experts believe that the overuse of
bronchodilators can cause asthma to get worse. They
advise patients and their physicians to consider control-
ling asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs including
inhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate
(Beclovent, Vanceril), flunisolide (AeroBid) or triamci-
nolone acetonide (Azmacort) Ideally, asthma should be
controlled with an inhaled steroid that is used along with
the bronchodilator. The more the inhaled steroid steroid
controls the inflammation that causes the asthma, the less
bronchodilator the patient needs to use because symp-
toms are under control.
Persons with diabetes should be aware that the bron-
chodilator epinephrine may raise their blood sugar levels.
Patients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator and
an aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroid
such as beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent,
Vanceril) should use the bronchodilator first, then wait 5
minutes before using the other medicine. Check with a
physician before using any other inhaled medications or
other asthma medicines. The physician must determine
the proper amount of time between doses.
Some bronchodilator products contain sulfites, that
trigger an allergic reaction in certain people. Anyone
who has a sulfite allergy should read the label carefully
or check with a physician or pharmacist before using a
bronchodilator. Call a physician immediately if any of
these signs of an allergic reaction to sulfite occur:
• bluish coloration of the skin
• flushed or red face or skin
• faintness
• severe dizziness
• increased wheezingor other breathing problems
• skin rash,hives, or itching
• swelling of the face, lips, or eyelids
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
use bronchodilators. Before using these drugs, be sure to
let the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES.Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to any bronchodilator or an inhaled form of any other
drug in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should also
be told about any allergiesto foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
Patients who are allergic to soybeans, soy lecithin,
peanuts, or drugs based on atropine should not use the
bronchodilator ipratropium (Atrovent).
PREGNANCY.In studies of laboratory animals, some
bronchodilators cause birth defectsor miscarriage
when the animals are given doses many times the usual
human dose. Whether these drugs cause such problems
in humans in unknown. Any woman who is pregnant or
plans to become pregnant should check with her physi-
cian before using a bronchodilator.
BREASTFEEDING.Some bronchodilators pass into
breast milk. Breastfeeding mothers should check with
their physicians before using bronchodilators.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using bron-
chodilators, people with any of these medical problems
should make sure their physicians are aware of their con-
ditions:
• glaucoma
• brain damage

Other side effects are possible. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after using a bronchodilator should
get in touch with his or her physician.
Interactions
Bronchodilators may interact with a number of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes these drugs should let the physi-
cian know all other medicines he or she is taking. Among
the drugs that may interact with bronchodilators are:
• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such
as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate),
used to treat depression
• other bronchodilators
• tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil)
and imipramine (Tofranil)
• beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol
(Tenormin), used to control high blood pressure
• digitalis medicines, used to treat heart conditions, such
as digoxin (Lanoxin)
• drugs, such as certain diuretics(water pills), that lower
potassium levels
• ergoloid mesylates such as Hydergine, used to treat
symptoms of Alzheimer’s diseaseor multiple small
stokes
• ergotamine (Cafergot, Ergostat, and other brands), used
to treat migraine and cluster headaches
• the antidepressant maprotiline (Ludiomil)

Bronchoscopy
Definition
Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a cylindrical
fiberoptic scope is inserted into the airways. This scope
contains a viewing device that allows the visual examina-
tion of the lower airways.
Purpose
During a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually
examine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea,
bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used to exam-
ine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalities
that might be associated with a variety of lung diseases.
Its use includes the visualization of airway obstructions
such as a tumor, or the collection of specimens for the
diagnosis of canceroriginating in the bronchi of the
lungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can also be used to collect
specimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases such
as tuberculosis. The type of specimens collected can
include sputum (composed of saliva and discharges from
the respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchi
or bronchioles, or cells collected from washing the lining
of the bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used in
bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindrical
instrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There are
two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is some-
times referred to as an open-tube or ventilating broncho-	scope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube. This tube con-	tains four smaller passages—two for light to pass	through, one for seeing through and one that can accom-	modate medical instruments that may be used for biopsy	or suctioning, or that medication can be passed through.
Bronchoscopy may be used for the following pur-
poses:
• to diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, lung infection, or
other lung disease
• to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs
• to remove a foreign body in the lungs, such as a mucus
plug, tumor, or excessive secretions
• to remove tissue samples, also known as biopsy, to test
for cancer cells, help with staging the advancement of
the lung cancer, or to treat a tumor with laser therapy
• to allow examination of a suspected tumor, obstruction,
secretion, bleeding, or foreign body in the airways
• to determine the cause of a persistent cough,wheezing,
or a cough that includes blood in the sputum
• to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments
Precautions
Patients not breathing adequately on their own due
to severe respiratory failuremay require mechanical
ventilation prior to bronchoscopy. It may not be appro-
priate to perform bronchoscopy on patients with an
unstable heart condition. All patients must be constantly
monitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that any
abnormal reactions can be dealt with immediately.
Description
There are two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube
and a fiberoptic tube. Because of its flexibility, the fiberop-

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 603  tic tube is usually preferred. However, if the purpose of the
procedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the wind-
pipe or lungs of a child, the more rigid tube must be used
because of its larger size. The patient will either lie face-up
on his/her back or sit upright in a chair. Medication to
decrease secretions, lessen anxiety, and relax the patient
are often given prior to the procedure. While breathing
through the nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth or
nose to numb it. It will take one to two minutes for the
anesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the broncho-
scope will be put into the patient’s mouth or nose and
moved down into the throat. While the bronchoscope is
moving down the throat, additional anesthesia is put into
the bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airways.
Using the eyepiece, the physician then observes the tra-
chea and bronchi, and the mucosal lining of these passage-
ways, looking for any abnormalities that may be present.
If the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissue
samples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial brush are used
to obtain cells. If the purpose is to identify an infectious
agent, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used to
gather fluid for culture purposes. Also, if any foreign
matter is found in the airways, it can be removed.
Another procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu-
orescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect pre-
cancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo-
rescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissue
will appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appear
green. This technique can help detect lung cancer at an
early stage, so that treatment can be started early.
Alternative procedures
Depending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,
alternatives might include a computed tomography scan
(CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per-
formed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on a
chest x rayor CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsy
specimens, one option is to perform surgery, which carries
greater risks. Another option is percutaneous (through the
skin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.
Preparation
The doctor should be informed of any allergiesand
all the medications that the patient is currently taking. The
doctor may instruct the patient not to take medications
like aspirinor anti-inflammatory drugs, which interfere
with clotting, for a period of time prior to the procedure.
The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro-
cedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day of
the procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60
minutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior to
the bronchoscopy, several tests may be done, including a
chest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy is
done under general anesthesia. Patients usually have an
intravenous (IV) line in the arm. Most likely, the proce-
dure will be done under local anesthesia, which is sprayed
into the nose or mouth. This is necessary to decrease the
gag reflex. A sedative may also be used to help the patient
relax. It is important that the patient understands that at no
time will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can be
supplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consent
form is necessary for this procedure.
Aftercare
After the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitored
for vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and
breathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes patients have
an abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All saliva should be
spit into a basin so that it can be examined for the pres-
ence of blood. If a biopsy was taken, the patient should
not cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge any
blood clot that has formed and cause bleeding. No food or
drink should be consumed for about two hours after the
procedure or until the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradu-
ally progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to the
patient’s regular diet. There will also be a temporary sore
throatand hoarseness that may last for a few days.

Bronchoscopy
Bronchoscope
Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a hollow, flexible
tube is inserted into the airways, allowing the physician to
visually examine the lower airways, including the larynx, tra-
chea, bronchi, and bronchioles. It can also be used to col-
lect specimens for bacteriological culture to diagnose infec-
tious diseases such as tuberculosis.(Illustration by Electronic
Illustrators Group.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 604  Risks
Minor side effects arise from the bronchoscope caus-
ing abrasion of the lining of the airways. This results in
some swelling and inflammation, as well as hoarseness
caused from abrading the vocal cords. If this abrasion is
more serious, it can lead to respiratory difficulty or bleed-
ing of the airway lining. A more serious risk involved in
having a bronchoscopy performed is the occurrence of a
pneumothorax, due to puncturing of the lungs, which
allows air to escape into the space between the lung and
the chest wall. These risks are greater with the use of a
rigid bronchoscope than with a fiberoptic bronchoscope.
If a rigid tube is used, there is also a risk of chipped teeth.
Normal results
Normal tracheal appearance consists of smooth
muscle with C-shaped rings of cartilage at regular inter-
vals. The trachea and the bronchi are lined with a mucous
membrane.
Abnormal results
Abnormal bronchoscopy findings may involve
abnormalities of the bronchial wall such as inflamma-
tion, swelling, ulceration, or anatomical abnormalities.
The bronchoscopy may also reveal the presence of
abnormal substances in the trachea and bronchi. If sam-
ples are taken, the results could indicate cancer, disease-
causing agents or other lung disease. Other abnormalities
include constriction or narrowing (stenosis), compres-
sion, dilation of vessels, or abnormal branching of the
bronchi. Abnormal substances that might be found in the
airways include blood, secretions, or mucous plugs. Any
abnormalities are discussed with the patient.
KEY TERMS
Anesthesia—A drug used to loss of sensation. It is
used to lessen the pain of surgery and medical
procedures.
Bronchi—The network of tubular passages that

Brucellosis
Definition
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by members
of the Brucellagenus that can infect humans but primari-
ly infects livestock. Symptoms of the disease include
intermittent fever, sweating, chills, aches, and mental
depression. The disease can become chronic and recur,
particularly if untreated.
Description
Also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, Gibraltar
fever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean fever, brucellosis
is most likely to occur among those individuals who reg-
ularly work with livestock. The disease originated in
domestic livestock but was passed on to wild animal
species, including the elk and buffalo of the western
United States. In humans, brucellosis continues to be
spread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infected
cows or through contact with the discharges of cattle and
goats during miscarriage. In areas of the world where
milk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin America
and the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted by
ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in the
United States, the widespread pasteurization of milk and
nearly complete eradication of the infection from cattle
has reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in
1940 to about 70 in 1994.
Causes and symptoms
The disease is caused by several different species of
parasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella. B. abortusis
found in cattle and can cause cows to abort their fetuses.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	605
Brucellosis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 605  B. suisis most often found in hogs and is more deadly
when contracted by humans than the organism found in
cattle. B. melitensisis found in goats and sheep and caus-
es the most severe illness in humans. B. rangiferiinfects
reindeer and caribou, and B. canisis found in dogs.
A human contracts the disease by coming into con-
tact with an infected animal and either allowing the bac-
teria to enter a cut, breathing in the bacteria, or by con-
suming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese obtained
from a contaminated animal. In the United States, the
disease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers.
Scientists do not agree about whether brucellosis
can be transmitted from one person to another, although
some people have been infected from a tainted blood
transfusionor bone marrow transplant. Newborn babies
have also contracted the illness from their mothers dur-
ing birth. Currently, it is believed that brucellosis can
also be transmitted sexually.
The disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittent
fevers (a source of its nickname, “undulant fever”) can be
exhausting. Symptoms usually appear between five days
and a month after exposure and begin with a single bout
of high fever accompanied by shivering, aching, and
drenching sweats that last for a few days. Other symp-
toms may include headache, poor appetite, backache,
weakness, and depression. Mental depression can be so
severe that the patient may become suicidal.
In rare, untreated cases, the disease can become so
severe that it leads to fatal complications, such as pneu-
moniaor bacterial meningitis. B. melitensiscan cause
miscarriages, especially during the first three months of
pregnancy. The condition can also occur in a chronic
form, in which symptoms recur over a period of months
or years.
KEY TERMS
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Chronic—Disease or condition characterized by
slow onset over a long period of time.
Parasite—An organism living in or on, and obtain-
ing nourishment from, another organism.
Pasteurization—The process of applying heat,
usually to milk or cheese, for the purpose of
killing, or retarding the development of, pathogen-
ic bacteria.
Diagnosis
Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one or
more Brucellaspecies in blood or urine samples. The
bacteria may be positively identified using biochemical
methods or using a technique whereby, if present in the
sample, the brucellosis bacteria are made to fluoresce.
Brucellosis may also be diagnosed by culturing and iso-
lating the bacteria from one of the above samples. Blood
samples will also indicate elevated antibody levels or
increased amounts of a protein produced directly in
response to infection with brucellosis bacteria.
Treatment
Prolonged treatment with antibiotics, including
tetracyclines(with streptomycin), co-trimoxazole, and
sulfonamides, is effective. Bed rest is also imperative. In
the chronic form of brucellosis, the symptoms may recur,
requiring a second course of treatment.
Prognosis
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to
prevent chronic infection. Untreated, the disease may linger
for years, but it is rarely fatal. Relapses may also occur.
Prevention
There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, but
humans can be protected by controlling the disease in
livestock. After checking to make sure an animal is not
already infected, and destroying those that are, all live-
stock should be immunized. Butchers and those who
work in slaughterhouses should wear protective glasses
and clothing, and protect broken skin from infection.
Some experts suggest that a person with the disease
refrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of the
disease. The sexual partners of an infected person should
also be closely monitored for signs of infection.

Bruises
Definition
Bruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and ten-
derness of the skin or mucous membranes due to the
leakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into the
tissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a disease
condition. A very small bruise is called a petechia. These
often appear as many tiny red dots clustered together,
and could indicate a serious problem.
Description
Bruises change colors over time in a predictable pat-
tern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injury
occurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise will
be reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. After
one to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down,
and the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color.
This fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth or
ninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have a
brown or yellowish appearance, and it will gradually
diminish back to its normal color.
Long periods of standing will cause the blood that
collects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruises
are actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood in	one place may flow downhill after awhile and appear in	another. For instance, bruising in the back of the	abdomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising in	the thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle.
Causes and symptoms
Healthy people may develop bruises from any injury
that doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercise
may also cause bruises due to bringing about small tears
in blood vessels walls. In a condition known as purpura
simplex, there is a tendency to bruise easily due to an
increased fragility of the blood vessels. Bruises also
develop easily in the elderly, because the skin and blood
vessels have a tendency to become thinner and more
fragile with aging, and there is an increased use of med-
ications that interfere with the blood clotting system. In
the condition known as purpura senilis, the elderly devel-
op bruises from minimal contact that may take up to sev-
eral months to completely heal.
The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as
ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead to
increased bruising. Aspirin, antidepressants,asthma
medications, and cortisone medications also have this
effect. The anti-clotting medications also known as blood
thinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin), may
be the cause of particularly severe bruising.
Sometimes bruises are connected with more serious
illnesses. There are a number of diseases that cause
excessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight to
have consequences in healthy people. An abnormal ten-
dency to bleed may be due to hereditary bleeding disor-
ders, certain prescription medications, diseases of the

fragility of blood vessels. If there are large areas of bruis-
ing or bruises develop very easily, this may herald a
problem. Other causes that should be ruled out include
liver disease,alcoholism, drug addiction, and acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Bruising that
occurs around the navel may indicate dangerous internal
bleeding; bruising behind the ear, called Battle’s sign,
may be due to a skull fracture; and raised bruises may
point to autoimmune disease.
Diagnosis
Bruising is usually a minor problem, which does not
require a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten-
sive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis-
ing in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu-
ation that will include a number of blood tests. If the area
of the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required.
Treatment
A bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is
often recommended that ice packs be applied on and off
during the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.
After that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommended
to increase the circulation and the healing of the injured
tissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres-
sion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation of
blood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannot
completely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, it
may have to be surgically removed.
Alternative treatment
Several types of topical applications are usually rec-
ommend to speed healing and to reduce the painassoci-
ated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied direct-
ly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witch
hazel,Hamamelis virginiana, can be used. This will
tighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising.
The homeopathic remedy,Arnica montana, can be
applied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.
Oral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,
pain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana, at 30 ml (1
oz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom-
mended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times per
day is also useful.
Prognosis
The blood under the skin which causes the discol-
oration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by the
body in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin color
should completely return to normal.
Sometimes, a bruise may become solid and increase
in size instead of dissolving. This may indicate blood
trapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained.
This is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, the
body may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in a
process called heterotopic ossification.
Prevention
Vitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood,
and therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruise
easily. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, broccoli, seaweed,
and fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K. Other
good foods to eat would be those containing
bioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These can
assist in strengthening the connective tissue, which will
decrease the spread of blood and bruising. Zinc and vita-
min C supplements are also recommended for this.

Bruxism
Definition
Bruxism is the habit of clenching and grinding the
teeth. It most often occurs at night during sleep, but it
may also occur during the day. It is an unconscious
behavior, perhaps performed to release anxiety, aggres-
sion, or anger.
Description
Bruxism is one of the oldest disorders known, and
approximately one in four adults experiences it. Most peo-
ple are not aware of it before their teeth have been damaged.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2608
Bruxism
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 608  Causes and symptoms
While bruxism is typically associated with stress,it
may also be triggered by abnormal occlusion (the way
the upper and lower teeth fit together), or crooked or
missing teeth.
Symptoms of bruxism include: dull headaches; sore
and tired facial muscles; earaches; sensitive teeth; and
locking, popping, and clicking of the jaw.
During a dental examination, a dentist may recognize
damage resulting from bruxism, including: enamel loss
from the chewing surfaces of teeth; flattened tooth surfaces;
loosened teeth; and fractured teeth and fillings. Left untreat-
ed, bruxism may lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction.
Diagnosis
Medical and dental histories and examinations are
necessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditions
that may cause similar pain, such as ear infections, dental
infections, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunc-
tion. However, uncommonly worn-down teeth strongly
suggest a diagnosis of bruxism.
Treatment
To prevent further damage to the teeth, bruxism is
treated by placing a removable, custom-fitted plastic
appliance called a night guard between the upper and
lower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding behav-
ior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic instead
of each other.
In some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjusted
and high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in a
more comfortable position. Missing teeth may be
replaced and crooked teeth may be straightened with
orthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlying
causes of bruxism. In cases where jaw muscles are very
tight, a dentist may prescribe muscle relaxants.
Alternative treatment
Stress management and behavior modification tech-
niques may be useful to break the habit of clenching and
teeth grinding. Tight jaw muscles may be relaxed by
applying warm compresses to the sides of the face.
Herbal muscle relaxants also can be helpful. Massage
therapyand deep tissue realignment, including rolfing,
can assist in releasing the clenching pattern. This is a
more permanent alternative treatment for bruxism.
Prognosis
Bruxism may cause permanent damage to teeth and
chronic jaw pain unless properly diagnosed and promptly

cannot flow out freely from the liver, blood pressure rises
in the veins of the liver, leading to blood clots within the
liver. Also, some of the blood plasma can leak through
the walls of the veins and accumulate within the
abdomen (ascites).
Causes and symptoms
The major symptoms include painin the upper
right-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of fluid
in the abdomen. In the United States, blood disorders are
the most common causes. Among these disorders are
polycythemia rubra vera (an increase in the number of
red blood cells), and sickle cell disease. In parts of the
world where liver canceris common, a form of liver
canceris the most frequent cause.
Other causes sometimes include:
• certain infections
• use of oral contraceptives
• body changes in pregnancyand the postpartum period
• phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
• injury to the abdomen
• membranous webs (especially in Asia)
KEY TERMS
Ascites—Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.
Biopsy—Surgical removal of a tiny bit of tissue for
examination under the microscope.
Catheter—A tubular surgical instrument.
Phlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.
Polycythemia rubra vera—An excess number of
red blood cells in the blood.
Sickle cell disease—An inherited disease in which
red blood cells take an unusual shape, leading to
circulation problems.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made by
an internist (a specialist in diseases of the internal
organs), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseases
of the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On physi-
cal examination, the doctor will note that the liver is
larger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the liver
will show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an abnor-
mal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other abnormali-
ties. A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities.
Once these abnormalities are confirmed, the key test
is called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a narrow
tube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepat-
ic veins. An instrument at the tip of the catheter can mea-
sure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein.
In some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material is
injected into a patient, and then an abnormal pattern of
radioactivity in the liver can be revealed. In other cases, a
liver biopsyenables a physician to examine cells from the
liver itself. Cells damaged by Budd-Chiari syndrome have a
characteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician.
Treatment
Surgery
Most patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome must
have surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow around
the clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the vena
cava. The exact technique will depend on the specific
location of the clots and other factors. In certain patients,
other surgical techniques may be used. For patients who
otherwise would have less than six months to live,liver
transplantationis sometimes performed.
In a few patients, a “balloon catheter” can open the
blocked blood vessels, without the need for major surgery.
Drugs
Sometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinase
can be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting in
the veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to work
when the clots have become established.
Prognosis
If surgery is done before permanent liver damage sets
in, long-term survival is possible. In these cases, damaged
liver cells can actually recover. If patients are already very
sick with liver disease, the surgery may not be as helpful.
Prevention
The best approach to prevention is to carefully control
the blood disorders that can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Buerger’s disease
Definition
Buerger’s disease is an inflammation of the arteries,
veins, and nerves in the legs, principally, leading to
restricted blood flow. Left untreated, Buerger’s disease
can lead to gangreneof the affected areas. Buerger’s dis-
ease is also known as thromboangitis obliterans.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of Buerger’s disease is not known. It
is seen most often in young to middle-aged men (ages
20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes. Cases of
this disease in non-smokers are very rare, hence, ciga-
rette smokingis considered a causative factor. Approxi-
mately 40% of the patients have a history of inflamma-
tion of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a role in the
development of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainly
seen in the legs of affected persons, but may also appear
in their arms. Early symptoms include decrease in the
blood supply (arterial ischemia) and superficial (near the
skin surface) phlebitis. The main symptom is painin the
affected areas. Onset of the disease is gradual and first
occurs in the feet or hands. Inflammation occurs in small
and medium-sized arteries and veins near the surface of
the limb. In advanced cases, blood vessels in other parts
of the body may be affected. There is a progressive
decrease in the blood flow to the affected areas. The
pulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. The
lack of blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decay
of tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivity
in the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease,
can develop. In this case, the hands turn color—white,
blue, and then red—when exposed to the cold.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually made from the clinical symp-
toms. Patients frequently complain of numbness, tin-
gling, or burning sensations in the affected area before
evidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparent.
KEY TERMS
Gangrene—A decay of the tissue in a part of the
body that experiences restricted blood flow.
Inflammation—A local reaction to irritation, injury,
or infection characterized by pain, swelling, red-
ness, and occasional loss of function.
Ischemia—A decrease in the blood supply to an
area of the body caused by obstruction or con-
striction of blood vessels.
Phlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.
Treatment
There is no effective medication or surgery for this
disease. Patients must stop smoking to halt further devel-
opment of the symptoms. Vasodilators, drugs that
increase the diameter of the blood vessels, can be admin-
istered, but may not be effective. Exposure of affected
areas to heat or cold should be avoided. Trauma to the
feet and other affected areas should be avoided and infec-
tions must be treated promptly.
Prognosis
The disease is progressive in patients who do not
stop smoking. Areas with gangrene must be removed sur-
gically.
Prevention
Smoking is the only known causative agent for this
disease and should be avoided.

Bulimia nervosa is a serious and sometimes life-
threatening eating disorder affecting mainly young
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	611
Bulimia nervosa
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 611  women. People with bulimia, known as bulimics, consume
large amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid them-
selves of the food and calories (purge) by fasting, exces-
sive exercise, vomiting, or using laxatives. The behavior
often serves to reduce stressand relieve anxiety. Because
bulimia results from an excessive concern with weight
control and self-image, and is often accompanied by
depression, it is also considered a psychiatric illness.
Description
Bulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for over
two million adolescent girls and young women in the
United States. The bingeing and purging activity associ-
ated with this disorder can cause severe damage, even
death, although the risk of death is not as high as for
anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that leads to exces-
sive weight loss.
Binge eating may in rare instances cause the stom-
ach to rupture. In the case of purging,heart failurecan
result due to loss of vital mineralssuch as potassium.
Vomiting causes other serious problems, including acid-
related scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit-
ing) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tube
that brings food from the mouth to the stomach (the
esophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glands
can become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can also
result, and interest in sex may diminish.
Most bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior
without professional help. Many typically recognize that
the behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Some
bulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviors
such as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer from
other psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression,
anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD).
Most bulimics are females in their teens or early 20s.
Males account for only 5-10% of all cases. People of all
races develop the disorder, but most of those diagnosed
are white.
Bulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy,
accompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly,
many people with bulimia appear healthy and successful,
while inside they have feelings of helplessness and low
self-esteem.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
The cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchers
believe that it may be caused by a combination of genetic
and environmental factors. Bulimia tends to run in fami-
lies. Research shows that certain brain chemicals, known
as neurotransmitters, may function abnormally in acutely
ill bulimia patients. Scientists also believe there may be a
link between bulimia and other psychiatric problems,
such as depression and OCD. Environmental influences
include participation in work or sports that emphasize
thinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam-
ily pressures also may play a role. One study found that
mothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh-
ters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to cause
bulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend to
have fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.
Symptoms
According to the American Anorexia/Bulimia Asso-
ciation, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:
• eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)
• vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, or engaging in
fasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)
• preoccupation with body weight
• using the bathroom frequently after meals
• depression or mood swings
• irregular menstrual periods
• onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,
heartburnor bloating
Diagnosis
Bulimia is treated most successfully when diag-
nosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is a
problem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com-
plete physical examinationin order to rule out other ill-
nesses is the first step to diagnosis.
According to the American Psychiatric Association,
a diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all of
the following symptoms:
• recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average
of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three
months)
• a feeling of lack of control over eating during the
binges
• regular use of one or more of the following to prevent
weight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or
diuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise
• persistent over-concern with body shape and weight
Treatment
Early treatment is important otherwise bulimia may
become chronic, with serious health consequences. A
comprehensive treatment plan is called for in order to
address the complex interaction of physical and psycho-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2612
Bulimia nervosa
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 612  logical problems in bulimia. A combination of drug and
behavioral therapies is commonly used.
Behavioral approaches include individual psychother-
apy,group therapy, and family therapy. Cognitive-
behavioral therapy, which teaches patients how to change
abnormal thoughts and behavior, is also used. Nutrition
counseling and self-help groups are often helpful.
Antidepressants commonly used to treat bulimia
include desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil),
and fluoxetine (Prozac). These medications also may
treat any co-existing depression.
In addition to professional treatment, family support
plays an important role in helping the bulimic person.
Encouragement and caring can provide the support needed
to convince the sick person to get help, stay with treatment,
or try again after a failure. Family members can help locate
resources, such as eating disorder clinics in local hospitals
or treatment programs in colleges designed for students.
Alternative treatment
Light therapy—exposure to bright, artificial light—
may be useful in reducing bulimic episodes, especially
during the dark winter months. Some feel that massage
may prove helpful, putting people in touch with the reali-
ty of their own bodies and correcting misconceptions of
body image. Hypnotherapymay help resolve uncon-
scious issues that contribute to bulimic behavior.
Prognosis
Bulimia may become chronic and lead to serious
health problems, including seizures, irregular heartbeat,
and thin bones. In rare cases, it may be fatal.
Timely therapy and medication can effectively man-
age the disorder and help the bulimic look forward to a
normal, productive, and fulfilling life.
Prevention
There is no known method to prevent bulimia.

Bundle branch block
Definition
Bundle branch block (BBB) is a disruption in the
normal flow of electrical pulses that drive the heart beat.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2	613
Bundle branch block
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 613  Description
Bundle branch block belongs to a group of heart prob-
lems called intraventricular conduction defects (IVCD).
There are two bundle branches, right and left. The right
bundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the
right ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart) and the left
bundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the
left ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at a
junction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses come
through the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of His
and then move into the right and left bundle branches.
Bundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerve
impulses. A problem may exist in any of the three bundles.
Patients with BBB are generally without symptoms
unless the disease is severe enough to cause a complete
infranodal A-V block and very slow heart rate. In patients
with right bundle branch block (RBBB), the nerve impulse
is conducted slowly or not at all. The right ventricle finally
receives the impulse through muscle-to-muscle spread,
outside the regular nerve pathway. This mechanism of
impulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed con-
traction of the right ventricle. There are several types of
left bundle branch block (LBBB), each producing its own
characteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, the
nerve impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBB
may have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy.
Causes and symptoms
Left bundle branch block usually happens as a con-
sequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis,
rheumatic fever,congenital heart disease,myocardi-
tis, myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, or
other invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branch
block happens less often from underlying heart disease.
Diagnosis
Detection of BBB usually takes place during a nor-
mal physical examination. The block shows up as a

widening of the second heart sound. Confirmation of
BBB is obtained by electrocardiogram (ECG). The pat-
tern seen in the electrocardiogram indicates pulses in a
heart beat and their duration. A QRS duration of greater
than 110 milliseconds is a diagnostic indication of BBB.
There is a unique ECG pattern for blocks in each of the
three bundles.
Treatment
There is no specific therapy for BBB. Patients are
usually treated for associated heart diseases.
Prognosis
The prognosis of blockage in any of the three bundle
branches depends on the prognosis of the associated heart
disease. The associated diseases determine the outcome
of the patient’s health. Occasionally, disruptions in bundle
branches lead to complete infranodal A-V block, a more
serious blockage of nerve impulses. Approximately 2% of
patients with BBB develop infranodal A-V blockage and
these patients often require artificial pacemakers.

Bunion
Definition
A bunion is an abnormal enlargement of the joint
(the first metatarsophalangeal joint, or MTPJ) at the base
of the great or big toe (hallux). It is caused by inflamma-
tion and usually results from chronic irritation and pres-
sure from poorly fitting footwear.
Description
A displacement of two major bones of the foot (hal-
lux valgus) causes bunions, although not everyone with
this displacement will develop the joint swelling and
bone overgrowth that characterize a bunion. One of the
bones involved is called the first metatarsal bone. This
bone is long and slender, with the big toe attached on one
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2614
Bunion
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 614  end and the other end connected to foot bones closer to
the ankle. This foot bone is displaced in the direction of
the four other metatarsals connected with the toes. The
other bone involved is the big toe itself, which is dis-
placed toward the smaller toes. As the big toe continues
to move toward the smaller toes, it may become dis-
placed under or over the second toe. The displacement of
these two foot bones causes a projection of bone on the
inside portion of the forefoot. The skin over this projec-
tion often becomes inflamed from rubbing against the
shoe, and a callus may form.
The joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled with
fluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to move
smoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac becomes
inflamed and thickened. The swelling in the joint causes
additional painand pressure in the toe.
Causes and symptoms
Bunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of
the foot during walking or running. One common exam-
ple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount of
stressplaced upon the inside of the foot. This leads to
friction and irritation of the involved structures. Age has
also been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in part
because the underlying bone displacement worsens over
time unless corrective measures are taken.
Wearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those
with a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, often
causes the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformity
is seen more often in women than men. The higher fre-
quency in females may be related to the strong link
between footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in a
recent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% wore
shoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow.
Because genetic factors can predispose people to the
hallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family history
of bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this
foot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and several
genetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn-
dromeand Marfan syndrome, cause muscle imbal-
ances that can create bunions from displacement of the
first metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes of
bunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunion
present on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to the
joint of the big toe.
Symptoms of bunions include the common signs of
inflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. The
discomfort is primarily located along the inside of the
foot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callus
may develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of the
toes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs.
Inflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion
with associated discomfort in the joint between the big
toe and the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skin
over the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, which
also presents a problem of potential infection. (Foot
ulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia-
betes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer forming
and healing if it becomes infected.)
Diagnosis
A thorough medical history and physical exam by a
physician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of
bunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con-
firm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement,
joint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth of
bone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con-
sider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by or
complicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of the
cartilage of the joint),gout(which causes the accumula-
tion of uric acid crystals in the joint), tiny fracturesof a
bone in the foot (stress fractures), or infection and may
order additional tests to rule out these possibilities.
Treatment
Conservative
The first step in treating a bunion is to remove as
much pressure from the area as possible. People with
bunions should wear shoes that have enough room in the
toe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid high-heeled
shoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings. Dressings and
pads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pres-
sure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts
(orthotics) to correct the alignment of the big toe joint is
effective for many bunions. Most patients are instructed to

GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 615  rest or choose exercises that put less stress on their feet, at
least until the misalignment is corrected. In some cases,
physicians also use steroid injections with local anesthetic
around the bunion to reduce inflammation.
Surgery
If conservative treatment is not successful, surgical
removal of the bunion may be necessary to correct the
deformity. This procedure is called a bunionectomy, and
there are many variations on the operation, which is usu-
ally performed by a surgeon who specializes in treating
bone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who specializes
in treating the foot (podiatry). Surgeons consider the
angle of the bone misalignment, the condition of the
bursa, and the strength of the bones when they choose
which procedure to use. Most bunionectomies involve
the removal of a section of bone and the insertion of pins
to rejoin the bone. Sometimes the surgeons may move
ligaments (which connect bone to bone in the joint) or
tendons (which connect bone to muscle) in order to
realign the bones. After this procedure, the bones and
other tissues are held in place while they heal by com-
pression dressings or a short cast. The individual must
refrain from vigorous exercisefor six weeks.
Alternative treatment
Deep friction massage techniques by a physical or
massage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation,
reduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue build up.
Physical therapy also provides useful approaches such as
ultrasound to help retard or reverse the formation of the
bunion. Various taping techniques can be useful to
realign the toe and decrease friction and rubbing that
may be present. The homeopathic tissue salt Calcarea
phosphoricacan be useful in balancing the bone forma-
tion/remodeling.
KEY TERMS
Orthopedics—A medical specialty concerned
with treating diseases, injuries, and malformations
of the bones and supporting structures, such as
tendons, ligaments, and muscles.
Orthotic—A device or brace to control, correct,
or compensate for a bone deformity.
Podiatry—A medical specialty concerned with
treating diseases, injuries, and malformations of
the feet.
Prognosis
Often modifications in footwear allow a good prog-
nosis without surgery. If surgery is necessary, complete
healing without complications requires approximately
four to six weeks. Even after surgery corrects the bone
misalignment, patients are usually instructed to continue
wearing low-heeled, roomy shoes to prevent the bunion
from reforming.
Prevention
Prevention begins with proper foot wear. Shoes with a
wide and deep toe box are best. High-heeled shoes should
not be worn for long periods of time. If a bunion is present
and becomes inflamed, the foot should be elevated with the
application of an ice pack over the painful area for not more
than 20 minutes every other hour. If pain and swelling con-
tinue, a podiatrist or physician should be contacted.

Burns
Definition
Burns are injuries to tissues caused by heat, friction,
electricity, radiation, or chemicals.
Description
Burns are characterized by degree, based on the
severity of the tissue damage. A first-degree burn causes
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2616
Burns
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 616  redness and swelling in the outermost layers of skin (epi-
dermis). A second-degree burn involves redness, swelling
and blistering, and the damage may extend beneath the
epidermis to deeper layers of skin (dermis). A third-
degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroys the
entire depth of skin, causing significant scarring. Damage
also may extend to the underlying fat, muscle, or bone.
The severity of the burn is also judged by the
amount of body surface area (BSA) involved. Health care
workers use the “rule of nines” to determine the percent-
age of BSA affected in patients more than 9 years old:
each arm with its hand is 9% of BSA; each leg with its
foot is 18%; the front of the torso is 18%; the back of the
torso, including the buttocks, is 18%; the head and neck
are 9%; and the genital area (perineum) is 1%. This rule
cannot be applied to a young child’s body proportions, so
BSA is estimated using the palm of the patient’s hand as
a measure of 1% area.
The severity of the burn will determine not only the
type of treatment, but also where the burn patient should
receive treatment. Minor burns may be treated at home or
in a doctor’s office. These are defined as first- or second-
degree burns covering less than 15% of an adult’s body
or less than 10% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn
on less than 2% BSA. Moderate burns should be treated
at a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degree
burns covering 15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-20%
of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10%
BSA. Critical, or major, burns are the most serious and
should be treated in a specialized burn unit of a hospital.
These are defined as first- or second-degree burns cover-
ing more than 25% of an adult’s body or more than 20%
of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on more than
10% BSA. In addition, burns involving the hands, feet,
face, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical. Other
factors influence the level of treatment needed, including
associated injuries such as bone fracturesand smoke
inhalation, presence of a chronic disease, or a history of
being abused. Also, children and the elderly are more
vulnerable to complications from burn injuries and
require more intensive care.
Causes and symptoms
Burns may be caused by even a brief encounter with
heat greater than 120°F (49°C). The source of this heat may
be the sun (causing a sunburn), hot liquids, steam, fire,

There are three classifications of burns: first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree burns.(Illustration by Electronic Illustra-
tors Group.)
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 617  Signs of a burn are localized redness, swelling, and
pain. A severe burn will also blister. The skin may also
peel, appear white or charred, and feel numb. A burn may
trigger a headacheand fever. Extensive burns may
induce shock, the symptoms of which are faintness,
weakness, rapid pulse and breathing, pale and clammy
skin, and bluish lips and fingernails.
Diagnosis
A physician will diagnose a burn based upon visual
examination, and will also ask the patient or family mem-
bers questions to determine the best treatment. He or she
may also check for smoke inhalation,carbon monoxide
poisoning, cyanide poisoning, other event-related trau-
ma, or, if suspected, further evidence of child abuse.
Treatment
Burn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventing
infection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, and
calorie intake while the body heals. Treatment of chemi-
cal or electrical burns is slightly different from the treat-
ment of thermal burns but the objectives are the same.
Thermal burn treatment
The first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop the
burning process. This may be accomplished by letting cool
water run over the burned area or by soaking it in cool (not
cold) water. Ice should never be applied to the burn. Cool
(not cold) wet compresses may provide some pain relief
when applied to small areas of first- and second-degree
burns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never be
applied to the burn since it prevents heat from escaping
and drives the burning process deeper into the skin.
If the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently with
soap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the skin
of the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to be
further irritated by pressure or friction, the burn should
be left exposed to the air to promote healing. If the skin
is broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area should
be coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment and cov-
ered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin,acetaminophen
(Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to ease pain
and relieve inflammation. A doctor should be consulted
if these signs of infection appear: increased warmth, red-
ness, pain, or swelling; pus or similar drainage from the
wound; swollen lymph nodes; or red streaks spreading
away from the burn.
In situations where a person has received moderate or
critical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence over
burn treatment and emergency medical assistance must be
called. A person with serious burns may stop breathing,
and artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation or rescue breathing) should be administered
immediately. Also, a person with burns covering more
than 12% BSA is likely to go into shock; this condition
may be prevented by laying the person flat and elevating
the feet about 12 in (30 cm). Burned arms and hands
should also be raised higher than the person’s heart.
In rescues, a blanket may be used to smother any
flames as the person is removed from danger. The person
whose clothing is on fire should “stop, drop, and roll” or
be assisted in lying flat on the ground and rolling to put
out the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comes
off easily should be removed; any clothing embedded in
the burn should not be disturbed. Removing any smol-
dering apparel and covering the person with a light, cool,
wet cloth, such as a sheet but not a blanket or towel, will
stop the burning process.
At the hospital, the staff will provide further med-
ical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be inserted if
the patient’s airways or lungs have been damaged, as
can happen during an explosion or a fire in a enclosed
space. Also, because burns dramatically deplete the
body of fluids, replacement fluids are administered
intravenously. The patient is also given antibioticsintra-
venously to prevent infection, and he or she may also
receive a tetanusshot, depending on his or her immu-
nization history. Once the burned area is cleaned and
treated with antibiotic cream or ointment, it is covered
in sterile bandages, which are changed two to three
times a day. Surgical removal of dead tissue (debride-
ment) also takes place. As the burns heal, thick, taut
scabs (eschar) form, which the doctor may have to cut to
improve blood flow to the more elastic healthy tissue
beneath. The patient will also undergo physical and

Burns
Classification Of Burns
First-Degree (Minor) The burned area is painful. The outer skin is reddened. Slight swelling is present.
Second-Degree (Moderate) The burned area is painful. The underskin is affected. Blisters may form. The area may have a wet, shiny appearance because of
exposed tissue.
Third-Degree (Critical) The burned area is insensitive due to the destruction of nerve endings. Skin is destroyed.Muscle tissues and bone underneath
may be damaged. The area may be charred, white, or grayish in color.
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 618  occupational therapy to keep the burned areas from
becoming inflexible and to minimize scarring.
In cases where the skin has been so damaged that it
cannot properly heal, a skin graft is usually performed. A
skin graft involves taking a piece of skin from an
unburned portion of the patient’s body (autograft) and
transplanting it to the burned area. When doctors cannot
immediately use the patient’s own skin, a temporary graft
is performed using the skin of a human donor (allograft),
either alive or dead, or the skin of an animal (xenograft),
usually that of a pig.
The burn victim also may be placed in a hyperbaric
chamber, if one is available. In a hyperbaric chamber
(which can be a specialized room or enclosed space), the
patient is exposed to pure oxygen under high pressure,
which can aid in healing. However, for this therapy to be
effective, the patient must be placed in a chamber within
24 hours of being burned.
Chemical burn treatment
Burns from liquid chemicals must be rinsed with
cool water for at least 15 minutes to stop the burning
process. Any burn to the eye must be similarly flushed
with water. In cases of burns from dry chemicals such as
lime, the powder should be completely brushed away
before the area is washed. Any clothing which may have
absorbed the chemical should be removed. The burn
should then be loosely covered with a sterile gauze pad
and the person taken to the hospital for further treatment.
A physician may be able to neutralize the offending
chemical with another before treating the burn like a
thermal burn of similar severity.
Electrical burn treatment
Before electrical burns are treated at the site of the
accident, the power source must be disconnected if possi-
ble and the victim moved away from it to keep the person
giving aid from being electrocuted. Lifesaving measures
again take priority over burn treatment, so breathing
must be checked and assisted if necessary. Electrical
burns should be loosely covered with sterile gauze pads
and the person taken to the hospital for further treatment.
Alternative treatment
In addition to the excellent treatment of burns pro-
vided by traditional medicine, some alternative
approaches may be helpful as well. (Major burns should
always be treated by a medical practitioner.) The homeo-
pathic remedies Cantharisand Causticumcan assist in
burn healing. A number of botanical remedies, applied
topically, can also help burns heal. These include aloe

Dermis—The basal layer of skin; it contains blood
and lymphatic vessels, nerves, glands, and hair

(Aloe barbadensis), oil of St.-John’s-wort (Hypericum
perforatum), calendula (Calendula officinalis), comfrey
(Symphytum officinale), and tea tree oil (Melaleucaspp.).
Supplementing the diet with vitamin C, vitamin E, and
zinc also is beneficial for wound healing.
Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent upon the degree of the
burn, the amount of body surface covered, whether criti-
cal body parts were affected, any additional injuries or
complications like infection, and the promptness of med-
ical treatment. Minor burns may heal in five to 10 days
with no scarring. Moderate burns may heal in 10-14 days
and may leave scarring. Critical or major burns take
more than 14 days to heal and will leave significant scar-
ring. Scar tissue may limit mobility and functionality, but
physical therapy may overcome these limitations. In
some cases, additional surgery may be advisable to
remove scar tissue and restore appearance.
Prevention
Burns are commonly received in residential fires.
Properly placed and working smoke detectors in combi-
nation with rapid evacuation plans will minimize a per-
son’s exposure to smoke and flames in the event of a fire.
Children must be taught never to play with matches,
lighters, fireworks, gasoline, and cleaning fluids.
Burns by scalding with hot water or other liquids
may be prevented by setting the water heater thermostat
no higher than 120°F (49°C), checking the temperature
of bath water before getting into the tub, and turning pot
handles on the stove out of the reach of children. Care
should be used when removing covers from pans of

heated in a microwave oven.
Thermal burns are often received from electrical
appliances. Care should be exercised around stoves,
space heaters, irons, and curling irons.
Sunburns may be avoided by the liberal use of a sun-
screen containing either an opaque active ingredient such
as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or a nonopaque active
ingredient such as PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) or
benzophenone. Hats, loose clothing, and umbrellas also
provide protection, especially between 10 
A.M. and 3 P.M.
when the most damaging ultraviolet rays are present in
direct sunlight.
Electrical burns may be prevented by covering unused
electrical outlets with safety plugs and keeping electrical
cords away from infants and toddlers who might chew on
them. Persons should also seek shelter indoors during a
thunderstorm to avoid being struck by lightning.
Chemical burns may be prevented by wearing protec-
tive clothing, including gloves and eyeshields. Chemical
agents should always be used according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions and properly stored when not in use.

Bursitis
Definition
Bursitis is the painful inflammation of the bursa, a
padlike sac found in areas subject to friction. Bursae
cushion the movement between the bones, tendons and
muscles near the joints. Bursitis is most often caused by
repetitive movement and is known by several common
names including weaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, and
miner’s elbow, depending on the affected individual’s
occupation and area of injury.
Description
There are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual-
ly bursae are present from birth, but they may form in
response to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a small
amount of synovial fluid,a clear liquid that acts as a
lubricant. Inflammation causes painon movement. The
most common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder
(subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecranon),
hips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes. The
affected area may be referred to as “frozen,” because
movement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae,
and all can become inflamed with overuse.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of bursitis is repeated
physical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason.
It can also be caused by trauma,rheumatoid arthritis,
gout, and acute or chronic infection.
Pain and tenderness are common symptoms. If the
affected joint is close to the skin, as with the shoulder,
knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and redness are
seen and the area may feel warm to the touch. The bursae
around the hip joint are deeper, and swelling is not obvi-
ous. Movement may be limited and is painful. In the
shoulder, it may be difficult to raise the arm out from the
side of the body. Putting on a jacket or combing the hair
becomes a troublesome activity.
In acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; with
chronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movement
reappear after exerciseor strain.
Diagnosis
When a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical
examinationis needed to determine what type of move-
ment is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bur-
sitis will not show up on x-rays, although sometimes
there are also calcium deposits in the joint that can be
seen. Inserting a thin needle into the affected bursa and
removing (aspirating) some of the synovial fluid for
examination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases,
the fluid will not be clear. It can be tested for the pres-
ence of microorganisms, which would indicate an infec-
tion, and crystals, which could indicate gout. In instances
where the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drug
that numbs the area) is injected into the painful spot. If
the discomfort stops temporarily, then bursitis is proba-
bly the correct diagnosis.
Treatment
Conservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec-
tive. The application of heat, rest, and immobilizationof
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2620
Bursitis
GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 620  the affected joint area is the first step. A sling can be used
for a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip problems.
The patient can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs(NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofin, and naproxen.
They can be obtained without a prescription and relieve
the pain and inflammation. Once the pain decreases,
exercises of the affected area can begin. If the nearby
muscles have become weak because of the disease or
prolonged immobility, then exercises to build strength
and improve movement are best. A doctor or physical
therapist can prescribe an effective regimen.
If the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition
like arthritis or gout, then management of that disease is
needed to control the bursitis.
When bursitis does not respond to conservative
treatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor-
ticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can bring imme-
diate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid is a hormonal
substance that is the most effective drug for reducing
inflammation. The drug is mixed with a local anesthetic
and works on the joint within five minutes. Usually one
injection is all that is needed.
Surgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per-
formed in extreme cases.
If the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi-
tional treatment is needed. Septicbursitis is caused by the
presence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ-
cus aureus.This is confirmed by examining a sample of
the fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi-
oticstaken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein
(intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained by
needle two or three times over the first week of treatment.
When a patient has such a serious infection, there may be
underlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes,
or an inefficient immune system caused by human
immunodeficiencyvirus infection (HIV).
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments take into consideration the
role of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of calcium
by the body, magnesium deficiency, and food allergies
may have a role. Diet changes and vitamin supplements
may be helpful. The use of herbs,homeopathy,aro-
matherapy, and hydrotherapycan help relieve symp-
toms. Ginger is useful in reducing inflammation.
Acupuncturehas been proven effective in treating hip
and shoulder pain caused by bursitis and other condi-
tions. Other therapies that deal effectively with muscu-
loskeletal problems (relating to the muscles and skele-
ton), may also be helpful, such as body work,magnetic
field therapy,naturopathic medicine,chiropractic,
and applied kinesiology.
KEY TERMS
Arthritis—Inflammation of a joint that may lead to
changes in the joint’s structure. It causes pain and
swelling. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease
that leads to crippling deformities.
Diabetes mellitus—A metabolic disease caused
by a deficiency of insulin, which is essential to
process carbohydrates in the body.
Gout—A hereditary metabolic disease that is a
form of arthritis and causes inflammation of the
joints. It is more common in men.
Inflammation—The reaction of tissue to injury.
Kinesiology—The science or study of movement.
Prognosis
Bursitis usually responds well to treatment, but it
may develop into a chronic condition if the underlying
cause is not corrected.
Prevention
Aggravating factors should be eliminated to prevent
bursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a movement
that triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing exer-
cises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will also
help. When doing repetitive tasks, frequent breaks should
be taken and the activity should be alternated with others
using different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, it
is a good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting and
foam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the elbows,
kneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a long period of
time should be avoided. Not wearing high heels can help
prevent bursitis in the heel, as can changing to new run-
ning shoes as soon as the old ones are worn out.

Byssinosis
Definition
Byssinosis is a chronic, asthma-like narrowing of the
airways. Also called brown lung disease, byssinosis results
from inhaling particles of cotton, flax, hemp, or jute.
Description
Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as a
source of respiratory disease more than 300 years ago,
byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational haz-
ard for textile workers for less than 50 years. More than
800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-making
industries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti-
cles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills that
manufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant risk
of dying of this disease.
In the United States, byssinosis is almost completely
limited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. More
than 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi-
nosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of the
people whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in the
textile-producing regions of North and South Carolina.
Causes and symptoms
Wheezing,shortness of breath, and a feeling of
tightness in the chest occur occasionally during the early
stages of the disease. Symptoms are usually more pro-
nounced when returning to work after a weekend, holi-
day, or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reac-
customed to the environment.
As many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have
symptoms that continue or recur throughout the work-
week. More severe breathing problems seem to result
both from exposure to high levels of dust and from
longer dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettes
suffer the most severe impairment.
Diagnosis
Tests that detect decreasing lung capacity during the
workday are used to diagnose byssinosis. Obstructive
patterns are likely in patients who have had recurrent
symptoms for more than 10 years.
Treatment
Therapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses on
reversing airway narrowing. Antihistaminesmay be pre-
scribed to reduce tightness in the chest. Bronchodilators
(drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve air
flow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form.
Reducing exposure is essential. Any worker who has
symptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathing
should transfer to a less-contaminated area.
Prognosis
Smoking, impaired lung function, and a history of
respiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of devel-
oping byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patients
wheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis. It
does not lead to permanently disabling lung disease.
Prevention
Eliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way
to prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improving
ventilation, and employing wetting procedures are very
successful methods of controlling dust levels to prevent
byssinosis. Protective equipment required during certain
procedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami-
nation that exceed the current United States standard for
cotton dust exposure.
